![<!--- Report card --->](images/final_checklist/report_cards/5.png)

6. If there are any comments, enter them on the comments page. 

  - For example, if any NA's are present due to less than 70% of data for that subset being available to calculate a score - note that here. Or, for example if the child was too young to receive a grade based score, you could note the aged based reading of the table here. 

  - If there are no comments, delete this page.
