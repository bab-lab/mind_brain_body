### Protocol - Troubleshooting 

  

#### If an item on the "reporting" list is activated regarding potential Domestic Violence 

  

- Researcher to chat with parent alone at the end of the session 

  

[Researcher say] *So now that we have reached the end of the session [child's name] is all done! Congratulations and thanks so much for your hard work today [child's name]! Can we just grab [parent's name] for a chat real quick? This last part will just be between mom/dad and me.* 

  

[Researcher to wait for child to leave] 

  

*Awesome! So I just wanted to check-in about something with you real quick. Your child may have answered an item in our questionnaires related to [parents pushing or shoving each other/parents throwing things during fights]. It is in our protocol to just check-in and make sure everything is alright at home. UCLA has many resources we can connect you to if necessary. Is everything alright?* 

  

**If yes, say**  

  

*Great! I am glad to hear it. Thanks for letting us know!* [Then proceed to thanking them for session and what to expect next week, etc.] 

  

**If no, say** 

  

*Are you in any immediate danger at the moment?*  

  

[If yes, say] *Thank you for letting me know. We are going to get in touch with our supervisor immediately. Please give me a moment to get in touch with her now.* Researcher will then slack and call Bridget immediately at 347-741-4103. 

  

[If no, say] *Would you like us to connect you with some resources at UCLA?* If yes, *What sort of support would you be looking for? I'll take this to my supervisor and she will give you recommendations and give you a call!* 

  

**If no, but you don't feel that everything is alright, say** 

  

*Thank you for letting me know! I know this might be a bit difficult to talk about, and as we mentioned earlier in the session it is just part of our protocol to check-in, so our supervisor will be giving you a call some time in the next 24 hours to ask you some more questions.* Researcher to slack Bridget immediately and call her at 347-741-4103.  

  

#### If Suicidal Ideation arises... 

  

Researcher to slack Bridget and call her immediately at 347-741-4103. Try to keep the person on the phone while Bridget gets in contact with the participant. If something happens and a participant mentions they may harm themselves/dropped off the call before you are able to reach Bridget, let Bridget know immediately and you will proceed together.  

  

#### If links in chat are not working... 

  

[Get them to have the links email open just in case] 

*You should have received an email from us right before this session full of links for today. Can you please pull that up to have it ready just in case? I will be sending you all of these links through the Zoom chat, but it will a good reference in case we have any technical difficulties! Once you have it up, you can co ahead and minimize the window.* 

  

  

#### If internet/wifi seems to be malfunctioning... 

  

[Try to get the best internet connection possible.] 

*Are you working on a computer that is connected via ethernet cable? We want to ensure you have the best internet connection possible for the session, as we will be doing many activities today that may need strong internet connection. Can you possibly transfer to a computer that is connected to an ethernet cable?* 

  

[If so, proceed] 

  

[If not, say] *Thats alright! If possible, can you please move to the best area of your house for internet connection?*  

  

[If this does not work, we are not IRB approved to use FaceTime or conduct session via phone yet. May need to reschedule session and/or contact Lab Manager for troubleshooting help.] 

  

  

#### Plan B to Zoom recording on PC interaction 

  

If Zoom recording is not possible, parents will be given same instructions - but told to record on their cell phone and upload to a secure private link. 

  

Participants can access the link [here](https://ucla.app.box.com/f/3c52df2afb1a446ab363b793f8af22c1). Parents can access this link from their mobile phone or computer.  

  

When they click on the link, they will see the screen below.

Parents can drag their video file directly from their phone/computer into the folder. 

  

The video will appear to the researchers in our Box under BABLAB/Studies/Mind_Brain_Body/Data/Wave_1_online/Wave_1_online_parent_child_interactions/Uploads 

  

Videos can then be renamed and organized by the researcher.
