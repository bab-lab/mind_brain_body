## Protocols - Session 1  

### Protocol - Consent & Assent Online

[ONCE ZOOM IS CONNECTED]

*Hi! Thank you so much for joining us today! We are so looking forward to today’s session with you. Usually, when we conduct a study such as this, we would do it our lab at UCLA. However, with COVID-19 we’ve decided it would be safer to carry out this study online for the time being- social distancing and all!* 

*Our session today should take around 1 hour long. In addition to what we do here today, there will be a follow up zoom appointment with us one week from now. At that appointment, we will reconnect on a second Zoom call in which your child will log on for 10 minutes and complete a computer game.*

*Sounds good? Let’s get started!*

[Researcher to open up the [MBB_Consent_Script_Presentation](https://ucla.app.box.com/file/689404174873)]

*First thing we are going to do is go over what is on the consent and assent forms. (These are the attached documents we sent you in the emails leading up to this session.) We will walk through, in a little bit more detail, all of the things we will be doing during today’s session.*

*During today’s online session we are going to be doing some interactive things. First, we are going to have you and your parent sit and talk about some fun things and some not so fun things while on ZOOM. This conversation will be recorded but we will not be watching or listening in*

*Next, we are going to have you play a game on the computer. In this game, you will be looking at pictures. Some of the pictures will be a bit scary, some sad, others a bit boring. While you are playing this game, your parent will stay with you in the room but will be working on some surveys to fill out.*

*After the game is over, your parent [NAME] will help measure your height, weight, and waist circumference.*

*You will also be answering some surveys (for children) with the researcher OR (for teens) on your own.*

*Lastly for today, your parent will help take two biological samples during this session.*

1. One is the hair sample which helps measure hormones that everyone has in their hair
2. Two is the saliva sample which helps tell us learn a little bit more about your microbiome
  - Do you know what a microbiome is?
  - A microbiome is all the little bacteria that live inside your mouth. Everyone has these, they are healthy! We just want to know what kind and how many of each there are.

*For helping us out in today’s session, you will be getting $45 for the work you put in! After this online session is over, we’ll ask you to do three more things at home:*

1. One is the Child poop sample – this helps us learn a bit more about your microbiome
  - There are also little bacteria that live in your tummy! Everyone has these and we want to know more about them.
2. Two is filling out the stool scale – this is a short scale that gives a description of your sample
3. Three is the computer memory game – this is when you will log back on with us via ZOOM in a week’s time to see what you remember from today’s session

*Great! Do you have any questions for us about any of the samples*

*When you complete the poop sample and the computer game at home, we will pay you another $20!*

*We will send the full payment of $65 ($45 for today’s session and $20 for completing the home session) as soon as we receive the samples back through the mail.*

*Here are some things to keep in mind:*

*You are a volunteer in this study, which means you do not have to do anything, or say anything, that makes you uncomfortable. We would like you to try everything you can, and to do your best, but if there are things you absolutely do not want to do, just tells us, that is o.k.*

*We will keep your participation confidential. You are given an ID number in order to keep your data confidential and separated from your name. Therefore, any identifying information (like your name, email, address, etc.) will be kept private and not paired with your data. We will also use a secondary ID number to save the videos with (since your faces are in it), which will help separate this from your name and the other data we collect form you. Only members of our research team will have access to your name and ID numbers.*

*I will rename your "ZOOM Name" right now with your Secondary ID number, to prepare for the recordings we will take in our session today* 

[Researcher will rename the participant's name to the participant Secondary MBB ID number. ![<!--- Zoom Parent Child Observation --->](images/zoom_parent_child_interaction/1.png)

*As this is a longitudinal study, and we want you to come again in the future if you are interested, we will ask for some information so that we may reach out to you in the future. Do you have any questions?*

*Ok- I will now send you a link through the Zoom chat, which will open up a survey that allows you to virtually indicate your consent to participate in the study. If you'd like, you can share your screen with us now and we can walk you through it. Once you get that pulled up, you will see the consent/assent documents attached there as well- please feel free to take your time reading through the consent and assent forms now if you’d like. As I mentioned earlier, these are the documents we had previously sent you in the emails leading up to today's session.*

[Then once they are done reading through]

*All set and any questions?*

[IF NO,] *Please click to indicate your consent/assent and submit the REDCap form. You may press submit once you are finished to “send in the form.”*

Researcher to grab magic box.

*Once you are all set with that, we’d like you for to grab the magic box we sent you in the mail. This contains everything you will need for today’s session and what you will do at home after today’s session.*

*If you haven't already done so, please open the magic box up. The magic box should contain a sheet of paper at the top which details all of the contents, but we will let you know when you need to take each item out of the box. Please set aside the magic box for now but keep the materials near you as we may need to access materials from the magic box throughout today’s session!*

*What you can pull out now and use throughout the session is the Reward Board and Gold Star Stickers. Use this reward board to track all the steps you accomplish today! Each space is like each task for the session. Once you complete the task you can put a gold star on the space!*

*Are you ready to get started on the session? Great, lets dive in!*

-----------------

### Protocol - Parent Child Observation Online

The parent and child will be seated together in view on the Zoom camera. During that time they will be filmed while solving a conflict, and then again while discussing a pleasant event. The conflict event will always go first, followed by the pleasant event. We did this to ensure that the parents were not thinking of the negative interaction upon answering the questionnaires about their child, which they did immediately after the observation interaction.

Step 1:
The researcher will ask the parent to find the [Pleasant/Unpleasant Events Checklist](https://ucla.app.box.com/file/630327764749) piece of paper from their session package.

*Researcher: So the first thing we will have you pull out of the magic box is the paper packet titled "Online Session Booklet." You can flip to the page that says "Pleasant Events and Issues Checklist."*

Researcher will wait for the participant to find the Online Session Booklet and flip to the correct page.

*Researcher: Next we are going to take some film of you while you discuss something that's hard and try to resolve it. On this piece of paper (Issues Cheklist) is a list of things that parents and children sometimes have disagreements about. We will give you a moment to read the list and think about some that you would like to discuss together. Then after about one minute, you will start discussing the things you have selected and try to resolve them. You do not need to tell us what you chose to discuss, and it does not matter if you chose something from this list, or decide to choose something else. I'll be there while you choose, but once your five minute discussion starts, I am going to turn off my camera and mute myself to be out of the recording. When you are ready, I will begin the recording and give you a minute or so to choose. Then, I will let you know when to start discussing for five minutes! Are you ready?*

Step 2: 
- Researcher will ensure Zoom security settings are set up for the video.
- Parent and child will be situated side-by-side in view on the Zoom camera.
-Researcher will press record on the Zoom application. ![<!--- Zoom Parent Child Observation --->](images/zoom_parent_child_interaction/3.png) Wait to hear the audio Zoom confirmation *"this meeting is now being recorded"* and view recording in progress at top left of screen to ensure recording is live. ![<!--- Zoom Parent Child Observation --->](images/zoom_parent_child_interaction/4.png) 
- Researcher set timer for 1 minute 

[After 1 minute has passed, say] *Ok, now it's time to get started. Remember, try to solve whatever problem or disagreement you talk about for the next five minutes. After, I will come back into the video call and give you further instructions. Do you have any questions?*

If no questions, proceed.

*Ok great! You can start chatting!*

Step 3:
- Researcher will mute themselves on Zoom and turn off their camera. 
- Researcher will start timer for 5 minutes. At the end of 5 minutes, reenter camera view and turn up volume on researcher's computer.

[After 5 minutes have passed, say] *Thank you for taking the time to discuss something difficult. Next we are going to take some film of you talking about something nice. On your "Pleasant Events Checklist" is a list of fun things that parents and children sometimes do together. I will give you a moment to read the list and pick something that you would like to plan to do together. Then after about one minute, you will start discussing the things you have selected and try to plan them. Again, you do not need to tell us what you chose to discuss, and it does not matter if you choose something from this list, or decide to choose something else. When you are ready, I will start the recording and then give you a minute to choose. Then, I will let you know when to start discussing for your five minutes!*

Step 4: 
- Researcher set timer for 1 minute.

*Ok, now it's time to get started. Remember, try to plan whatever fun thing you talk about for the next five minutes. After, I will come back into the video call and give you further instructions. Do you have any questions?*

If no questions, proceed.

Step 5:
- Researcher will start timer for 5 minutes. 

Step 6:
- After five minutes, researcher reenters the room and back into camera view, turns up volume on the computer, and stops the recording on Zoom. ![<!--- Zoom Parent Child Observation --->](images/zoom_parent_child_interaction/5.png) You will view this notification in the upper right hand corner that states the recorded file will be converted to mp4 once the meeting ends. ![<!--- Zoom Parent Child Observation --->](images/zoom_parent_child_interaction/6.png) Move the child/adolescent and parent onto the next task in the session, as the video will not be saved until after the session is complete.

**Please visit "Post-Online Session Protocols to view instructions on how to save the video recording.**

#### Plan B

If Zoom recording is not possible, parents will be given same instructions - but told to record on their cell phone and upload to a secure private link.

Participants can access the link [here](https://ucla.app.box.com/f/3c52df2afb1a446ab363b793f8af22c1). Parents can access this link from their mobile phone or computer. 

When they click on the link, they will see the screen below.

![<!--- Parent Child Observation Plan B --->](images/zoom_parent_child_interaction/13.png) 

Parents can drag their video file directly from their phone/computer into the folder.

The video will appear to the researchers in our Box under BABLAB/Studies/Mind_Brain_Body/Data/Wave_1_online/Wave_1_online_parent_child_interactions/Uploads

Videos can then be renamed and organized by the researcher. 

-----------------

### Protocol - Halloween Training/Parent Questionnaires

*Now we are done with the group activity. You can go ahead and take out your token board and gold star stickers, and stick one golden star on the first block, where the movie icon is!* 

*Next we will move on to some individual activities, where Mom/Dad will complete some surveys while you [Child's name] plays a computer game. The computer game is about your child’s learning and memory so it is important they dont get help from you! We actually prefer you don't watch the screen so you dont know which pictures they see. If you recall the example from our powerpoint at the beginning of this session, this will be the time that your child will see some pictures on the screen*

*So to get your child setup for the computer game, we will send you a link through the Zoom chat now. Let me know once the link has loaded.*

[Researcher to send Gorilla task link through the chat, then wait for them to pull it up.]

If necessary - the link can be found [here](https://research.sc/participant/login/20451/publicid).

[Then, confirm they are on the right page] *You should be seeing a login screen that asks you to enter your participant ID screen.*

![<!--- Halloween login screen --->](images/halloween/7.png)

*You can now enter your MBB number on the screen, but DON'T click start yet!*

*While your child is doing the game, you can get started on some parent surveys. So now I will ask you to reach into your Session Package and pull out the booklet titled "Parent Survey Booklet" and a pencil to fill these out.*

[Wait for parent to pull the parent survey booklet out]

*We ask that you please fill the surveys out in the order that they are presented. Some of these surveys are about your child and some of these surveys are about you. The game will take around 15-20 minutes and I will notify you when we are finished. Don't worry - you will have time to return to the surveys during another part of this session! You can go ahead and work on the surveys now and your child can start the game. It will tell you once the game is over, and we can regroup!*

*Ok! If you are both ready to start, we will just have Mom/Dad click "Log in" on [Child's name]'s page, and you can both get started!*

*Ok, [Child's name]- so in this computer game, you are going to go on a trick-or-treating adventure! Some of the places you visit will be nice, and some will be a little scary. Your job is to remember what toys and candy you got in the different places. Are you ready? Ok! You can click Start!*

[If participants do not seem to check-in with researcher after ~15 minutes, ask if they have any questions] *Hi, just wanted to check-in and see if everything was going alright. Do you have any questions?*

[Once the Halloween training is complete, say] *Great job! We have completed the second part of this session- you can go ahead and take out your token board and gold star stickers, and put another star on the second block!*

-----------------

### Protocol - Height Online

*Ok, for the next part of this session, we will have you (parent) pause on your surveys so you can help take some measurements from your child (height, weight, and waist). I will ask you to reach into your Magic Box and pull out the "Session Booklet", a pencil, and the paper measuring tape.*

[Wait for participant to retrieve session booklet, pencil, and paper measuring tape]

*This booklet contains all the instructions for our measurements and sample collections during today's session, which you can use for reference if you'd like. I will also walk you through each measurement and collection!*

*We will start with Height! Feel free to grab your paper measuring tape and measure your child's height in inches.*

[Researcher to note child's height on the session checklist google form.]

*Awesome job! We have completed the next part of this session- you can go ahead and take out your token board and gold star stickers, and put another star on the second block!*

- Researcher will be walking the parent through how to measure their child's height via Zoom video call. Ask parent if they have a full length measurement tape. If not, we will proceed with the paper measurement tape.
- Ask parent to place child/adolescent directly against wall/frame
- Advise child/adolescent to stand up straight
- Have parent ensure heels of child/adolescent are up against the wall/frame
- Use a flat object (booklet, ruler, sheet of paper, etc.) to accurately mark the height on the wall/frame
- Use the paper measuring tape to scale up the wall and measure the height marking
- Record height on Online Session Checklist

-----------------

### Protocol - Weight Online

*Next, we will do weight! Do you have a weight scale?*

[If yes, say] *Please go and weigh your child, and return to the screen so we may record the number.* [Researcher to note child's weight on the session checklist google form.]

[If no, say] *Can you please record an estimate of your child's weight?* [Researcher to note child's weight and check "approximated" on the session checklist google form.]

*[Child's name] you can go ahead and put another star on your token board!*

- Instruct parent to have child/adolescent to step on weight scale
- Measure weight
- Record weight on Online Session Checklist
- Specify on Online Session Checklist if weight was estimated or not

-----------------

### Protocol - Waist Measurement Online

*Next, we will do the Waist measurement! You can go ahead and grab that paper measuring tape once again, and measure your child's waist at the belly button. You can do this over their t-shirt.*

[Researcher to note child's waist on the session checklist google form.]

*Great! [Child's name]- you can stick another star on your token board! Look- we are about halfway there!*

- Advise parent to hold tape measure at the child/adolescent's belly button and bring it around their waist, over their t-shirt
- Make sure measuring tape is horizontal around the waist and even in the front and back
- Keep the tape snug around the waist, but not compressing the skin
- Have participant breathe in
- Measure the participant’s waist just after they breathe out
- Record waist measurement on Online Session Checklist


-----------------

### Protocol - Halloween Test Online

*OK! It is time to go back to our learning and memory section. Can you please log back onto the "Gorilla" website. If you still have the browser up that's great - please refresh the screen to continue. If not, you can go back to the same link as before and enter your MBB ID. Here you will be completing the second part of the computer game.*

[Wait for child to log back on]

If necessary - the link can be found [here](https://research.sc/participant/login/20451/publicid).

[Confirm that they are on the correct page] *If you left your browser up, you should see Part 2 of the game, if you had to click on the link again, you should see the samee logon screen where you can enter your MBB ID.*

[Once confirmed, let the parent know they can resume on their parent surveys during this time] *So just to reiterate, this next part is about your child’s learning and memory so it is important they dont get help from you! We prefer you don't watch the screen so you don't know which pictures they see. While you wait for your child to complete their task for the next 15 minutes, you can get continue on your parent surveys. Once your child is finished, we can regroup!*

[Give child instructions on Halloween Test] *Ok [Child's name]- now we want to see how much of your trick-or-treating adventure you remember. So now, you will be asked what toys and candy you got in the different places. Are you ready? Ok! You can click Start!*

[If particiapnts do not seem to check-in with researcher after ~15 minutes, ask if they have any questions] *Hi, just wanted to check-in and see if everything was going alright. Do you have any questions?*

*[Child's name] great job! Now that we are done with the computer game, you can go ahead and put another star on your token board!*

[Once the Halloween test is complete, you may proceed to Saliva Sample Collection]

-----------------

### Protocol - Saliva Sample Online

*Now, we will do some sample collections! The first one is the Spit Sample. As I mentioned earlier, you can flip to the instructions in your session booklet if you would like, but I will also walk you through it step-by-step! First, please grab your "spit tube" from the Magic Box. When you are ready, I will let you know what to do next!*

[Researcher to walk through Saliva Sample.]

*You can throw away all of the packaging once you have finished with the spit tube. All you need to return to us is the tube inside the biohazard bag with two cotton balls, inside the white cardboard box.*

*We are now done with our spit collection! You can put another gold star on your token board!*

- Researcher has saliva "spit tube" example for explanation to participants
