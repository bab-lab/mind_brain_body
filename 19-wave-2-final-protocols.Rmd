## Protocols - Final 

  

### Protocol - Storing Saliva Sample  

  

- Screw lids on very tight (to prevent evaporation) 

- Log the location (grid) on the sample storage log 

  

----------------- 

  

### Protocol - Storing Hair Sample  

  

- Store the sample in a dry area at room temperature 

  

----------------- 

  

### Protocol - Storing Stool Sample 

  

#### Sample Quality  

  

- Put on gloves. 

- Open the mailer to ensure that it contains both the stool sample (in biohazard bag) and the Bristol Stool Scale. 

- Check for quality of the stool sample by shaking it up and down vigorously (keep the sample in the biohazard bag), then check for its consistency and color - It should be a dark-brown liquid. 

- If stool sample does not meet requirement (e.g. sample is in solid form or amount collected is too little), contact the family to see if they would be willing to send another sample with compensation.  

- Contact family if the Bristol Stool Scale is missing in the mailer.  

  

#### Sample Transfer 

  

- Wear appropriate PPE: 

    - Gloves 

    - Lab coat 

    - Safety glasses 

    - Surgical Mask 

    - Closed-toe shoes 

    - Long pants 

    - Hair tied back 

     

  

- Prepare your station and ensure that you have the following: 

    - 2.0mL cryogenic vials  

    - Stool samples in biohazard bag  

    - Test tube racks 

    - Transport box with divider 

    - Sharpie for labeling 



**Steps:** 

  

- Clean workspace prior to placing shield down and paper towel over shield 

- Untwist two 2.0mL vials and place them on the side of the shield to prepare 

- With the stool sample collection vial still in the biohazard bag, shake it up and down vigorously 

- Take the stool sample out of the bag and label with industrial sharpie 

- Take a photo of the sample to store on Box 

- Untwist the stool sample collection vial, and carefully pour the sample into the first 2.0mL vial (It’s okay if the ball does or does not get transferred) 

- Stop pouring when solution reached the 1.8mL line to prevent overflow, and pour the remaining sample (if any) in a second 2.0mL vial 

- Cap the 2.0mL vials tightly to prevent spills 

- Label the 2.0mL vials with an industrial sharpie, ensure it has the participant ID and Wave and vial number 

- Place the labeled 2.0mL vials in the transport box with divider 

- Close the now-empty stool sample collection vial, put it back in the biohazard bag, and dispose it in the biohazard waste bin 

- Clean-up work station, dispose the drape, and wipe down the table top with disinfectant wipe. 

- Remove PPE and wash hands with soap and water thoroughly 

- Bring the transport box to the -20 upright freezer in HPL 

- Place the 2.0mL vials in their designated space in the freezer box (in accordance to the Sample Storage Log Diagram) 

- Log the sample in the [Sample Storage Log](https://app.box.com/file/630322897864) 

- Update the Stool Quality on REDCap 

  

#### Taking out the Hazards 

 

-Take the Hazards key with you from the lock box in the Lab. Make sure there are two keys attached- a large gold key and a small gold key. 

-Head to HPL. Once inside, put on PPE. 

-Find the large gray cart in the back room, and wheel into the main HPL lab space. This will assist you in carrying the Hazards bin to the waste area. Put the entire Hazards bin (with the hazards bag full of materials) onto the gray cart.  

-Ensure you either leave the HPL keys in the lockbox on the door or take them with you. 

-Wheel the cart to the elevator and take it down to level A. Turn right into the hallway and take another right out to the double doors that lead to the loading dock. Exit the building and be sure to close both doors- these doors cannot be propped open. 

-Wheel the cart to the gate. Use the small gold key to open the lock holding together the chains that lock the gate closed. Once you have the gate open, carry the hazards bin inside. 

-Take out the hazards bag and tie it closed. Leave the tied hazards bag in one of the red bins in the corner. 

-Bring the hazards bin back to the gray cart. Use the gold key to lock the chains and gate back up.  

-Use the large gold key to reenter through the double doors. Take the elevator back to floor 1. Head back to HPL. 

-Once back in HPL, find a new hazards bag- the Brain and Body Lab hazards bags are located on the first shelf above our space in the corner. If we run out, Dr. Robles kindly invited us to use the Hazards bags in the HPL space which are located underneath the tables by the refrigerator.  

-Discard your gloves into the newly replaced hazards bag.  

-Make sure to return the Hazards keys to the lock box in BABLAB.
