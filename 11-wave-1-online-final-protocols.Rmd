## Protocols - Final

### Protocol - Parent Child Observation 

#### Coding the interview 

- After the interviews are collected, videos will be coded by two observers blind to the caregiving group of the child (adversity or comparison). 

- Our original plan was to follow the LIFE coding system developed by Hops:
   - Hops H, Davis B, Longoria N. Methodological issues in direct observation – Illustrations with the Living in Familial Environments (LIFE) coding system. Journal of Clinical Child Psychology. 1995;24:193–203. [Google Scholar](https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1207/s15374424jccp2402_7?journalCode=hcap19)

- However, this system is prohibitively expensive and very training intensive. Instead we decided to go with either of the following two coding schedules: 
   - 1. Family Interaction Macrocoding Schedule (FIMS) Holmbeck, Zebracki, Johnson, Belvedere, & Hommeyer, 2007.
   - 2. CIB Training with Ruth Feldman.
   
- We ultimately decided to go with FIMS for several reasons: 
    - Expense - Sarah Whittle paid approximately $ 1000USD for a 10 hour skype training session with one of Holmbeck’s team), whereas CIB training is /$2500 and also involves flights and accommodation at Yale. 
    - Validation in age range - I like CIB for younger children, but FIMS was designed for older children and adolescents, and Sarah Whittle has validated it in a community sample of 8 year olds and their mothers. 
    - FIMS is a less intensive coding schedule, producing global codes, rather than micro coded (i.e., minute to minute) scales - which makes more intuitive sense in the age range for MBB. 
    - FIMS has a peer version that we might brach out to in the future (but likely not needing further training): https://psycnet.apa.org/record/2014-24011-001
    - Sarah Whittle’s group looked at the component structure for the FIMS and found components that seemed close to what they were finding with the Hops LIFE system - namely: negative maternal affect during pleasant event, negative maternal during conflict discussion, and pleasant maternal affect across both tasks (warmth). The negative maternal during pleasant event was the most predictive of child behavior problems. Overall, the correlations they report in their paper are all very sensical and convinced me that we should use the FIMS. https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/full/10.1177/1073191118796557

### Protocol - Saliva Sample Storage

- Screw lids on very tight (to prevent evaporation)
- Log the location (grid) on the sample storage log

-----------------

### Protocol - Hair Sample Storage

- Store the sample in a dry area at room temperature

-----------------

### Protocol - Stool Sample Storage

#### Sample Quality 

- Put on gloves.
- Open the mailer to ensure that it contains both the stool sample (in biohazard bag) and the Bristol Stool Scale.
- Check for quality of the stool sample by shaking it up and down vigorously (keep the sample in the biohazard bag), then check for its consistency and color - It should be a dark-brown liquid.
- If stool sample does not meet requirement (e.g. sample is in solid form or amount collected is too little), contact the family to see if they would be willing to send another sample with compensation. 
- Contact family if the Bristol Stool Scale is missing in the mailer. 

#### Sample Transfer

- Wear appropriate PPE:
    - Gloves
    - Lab coat
    - Safety glasses
    - Surgical Mask
    - Closed-toe shoes
    - Long pants
    - Hair tied back
    

- Prepare your station and ensure that you have the following:
    - Drape
    - 2.0mL cryogenic vials 
    - Stool samples in biohazard bag 
    - Test tube racks
    - Transport box with divider
    - Sharpie for labeling


**Steps:**

- Lay a new drape on the work station and keep all equipments and sample on the drape throughout the transfer process.
- With the stool sample collection vial still in the biohazard bag, shake it up and down vigorously.
- Take the stool sample out of the bag and put it on the test tube rack.
- Untwist two 2.0mL vials and place them on the test tube rack. 
- Untwist the stool sample collection vial, and carefully pour the sample into the first 2.0mL vial. (It’s okay if the ball does or does not get transferred)
- Stop pouring when solution reached the 1.8mL line to prevent overflow, and pour the remaining sample (if any) in a second 2.0mL vial. 
- Cap the 2.0mL vials tightly to prevent spills. 
- Label the 2.0mL vials with a sharpie, ensure it has the participant ID and vial number.
- Place the labeled 2.0mL vials in the transport box with divider.
- Close the now-empty stool sample collection vial, put it back in the biohazard bag, and dispose it in the biohazard waste bin. 
- Clean up work station, dispose the drape, and wipe down the table top with disinfectant wipe.
- Remove PPE and wash hands with soap and water thoroughly.
- Bring the transport box to C454 where the -80˚C freezer is located (key in BABLab Lock Box).
- Place the 2.0mL vials in their designated space in the freezer box (in accordance to the Sample Storage Log Diagram). 
- Log the sample in the [Sample Storage Log](https://app.box.com/file/630322897864).

### Protocol - Data Review & Audit 

#### Follow-Up (completed by Scheduling Coordinator)

- Before sending Home Reminder 3, make sure RA’s have completed Data Entry, Data Quality Check 1, and Data Quality Check 2.
- After sending Home Reminder 3 - create blank Trello card for participant on "In Data Review" list of Data Audit Board.

#### Data Review

- Once card has been created, do Data Review.
- Checking for completion of:
  - child questionnaires (see child questionnaire table)
  - parent proxy questionnaires (see parentproxy questionnaire table)
