<h3>Checklist - Initial Online</h3>
<p><strong>Calling participants from REDCap</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Participants can be considered “lost to follow up” if they meet all of the following criteria:
<ul>
<li>Researcher has tried to contact individual at different times of day.</li>
<li>Researcher has used at least 2 different approaches (e.g. email and phone), UNLESS only 1 form of contact has been given, in which case participant should fully meet all other criteria.</li>
<li>Person has been contact at least 4 times.</li>
<li>Situation is NOT considered “phone tag” (a participant calls and lab member returns call but keeps missing one another- this shows participant may still be interested, therefore number of contact and lack of response may not be due to lack of interest. Participants in “phone tag” situation should stay on contact list).</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Waitlist criteria</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>This regards the “out of town” option on the wave1_Status on REDCap</li>
<li>Should include:
<ul>
<li>any participants here live outside of LA, and won’t be coming back to LA (e.g. did not relocate just for COVID-19 pandemic purposes)</li>
<li>participants whose age tally exceed 15, the target collection number for each age group in our age range. Refer to the <a href="https://ucla.app.box.com/file/724688028024">Participant Tally</a> for reference.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>PLEASE NOTE: Participants who have not aged out yet, or who are not free at the moment yet, OR live outside the US but plan to come back as soon as the pandemic is over should all still be kept on the contact log and just have a future recontact date. We only want to put people who are going on our “out of town” waitlist (like a plan B, only contact if necessary)!</strong></p>
<p>We will only refer to the waitlist if (1) we will be behind on recruitment for Wave 1 and will need to just schedule people who we know cannot come back for future waves to complete data collection or (2) we will be behind on recruitment for Wave 1 and will need to just schedule people who are anywhere within our age range, rather than targeted numbers by age to complete data collection (3) we have to stay in the pandemic and all future waves will be remote.</p>
<p><strong>Scheduling and Confirmation</strong></p>
<ul>

<div id="protocol---welcome-zoom-introduction" class="section level3">
<h3>Protocol - Welcome &amp; Zoom Introduction</h3>
<p>[ONCE ZOOM IS CONNECTED]</p>
<p><em>Hi! Thank you so much for joining us today! We are so looking forward to today’s session with you. Usually, when we conduct a study such as this, we would do it our lab at UCLA. However, with COVID-19 we’ve decided it would be safer to carry out this study online for the time being- social distancing and all!</em></p>
<p><em>Our session today should take around 2 hours long. In addition to what we do here today, there will be a follow up zoom appointment with us one week from now. At that appointment, we will reconnect on a second Zoom call in which your child will log on for 15 minutes and complete a computer game.</em></p>
<p><em>So first, I’ll just ask- have you ever used Zoom before?</em></p>
<p>[If yes, say] <em>Great! So you are probably familiar with the different functions here, but I will just give you a little refresher on some buttons we will need for today. The most important thing you need to be aware of is the “chat” button below. If you click on it, a chat box should open- I will be using this throughuot the session to send you imporant links. You may already know this, but you can also display your camera so that it is in gallery view or speaker view in the top right corner. I think it might be best for you to do speaker view so it will feel more like we are in the room together!</em></p>
<p>[If no, say] <em>No problem! Welcome to Zoom- it is very easy to use! The most important thing you need to be aware of is the “chat” button below. If you click on it, a chat box should open- I will be using this throughuot the session to send you imporant links. You can also display your camera so that it is in gallery view or speaker view in the top right corner. I think it might be best for you to do speaker view so it will feel more like we are in the room together!</em></p>
<p>[Troubleshooting…]</p>
<p><em>Great! If for any reason, we lose each other over Zoom, the connection seems to be bad, or one of us freezes, lets leave the session and try to reconnect on the same link again. If I am frozen- feel free to leave and come back. If you leave and I don;t see you come back, I will try to give you a phone call!</em></p>
<p><em>How does that sound? Do you have any questions?</em></p>
<p>[If no, say] <em>Great! Lets switch gears and talk a little bit about what we are going to do today. Let me just pull up a little presentation we have got!</em></p>
<p>[Researcher to open up the <a href="https://ucla.app.box.com/file/729637683371?sb=/activity">MBB_Consent_Script_Presentation</a>]</p>
</div>
<div id="protocol---consent-assent-online" class="section level3">
<h3>Protocol - Consent &amp; Assent Online</h3>
<p><em>First thing we are going to do is go over what is on the consent and assent forms. (These are the attached documents we sent you in the emails leading up to this session.) We will walk through, in a little bit more detail, all of the things we will be doing during today’s session.</em></p>
<p><em>During today’s online session we are going to be doing some interactive things. First, we are going to have you and your parent sit and talk about some not so fun things and some fun things while on ZOOM. This conversation will be recorded but we will not be watching or listening in</em></p>
<p><em>Next, we are going to have you play a game on the computer. In this game, you will be looking at pictures. Some of the pictures will be a bit scary, some sad, others a bit boring. While you are playing this game, your parent will stay with you in the room but will be working on some surveys to fill out.</em></p>
<p><em>After the game is over, your parent [NAME] will help measure your height, weight, and waist circumference.</em></p>
<p><em>You will also be answering some surveys (for children) with the researcher OR (for teens) on your own.</em></p>
<p><em>Lastly for today, your parent will help take two biological samples during this session.</em></p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>One is the hair sample which helps measure hormones that everyone has in their hair</li>
<li>Two is the split sample which helps tell us learn a little bit more about your microbiome</li>
</ol>
<ul>
<li>Do you know what a microbiome is?</li>
<li>A microbiome is all the little bacteria that live inside your mouth. Everyone has these, they are healthy! We just want to know what kind and how many of each there are.</li>
</ul>
<p><em>For helping us out in today’s session, you will be getting $45 for the work you put in! After this online session is over, we’ll ask you to do three more things in the second session:</em></p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>One is the Child poop sample – this helps us learn a bit more about your microbiome</li>
</ol>
<ul>
<li>There are also little bacteria that live in your tummy! Everyone has these and we want to know more about them.</li>
</ul>
<ol start="2" style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>Two is filling out the stool scale – this is a short scale that gives a description of your sample</li>
<li>Three is the computer memory game – this is when you will log back on with us via ZOOM in a week’s time to see what you remember from today’s session</li>
</ol>
<p><em>Great! Do you have any questions for us about any of the samples</em></p>
<p><em>When you complete the poop sample and the computer game as apart of Session 2, we will pay you another $20!</em></p>
<p><em>We will send the full payment of $65 ($45 for today’s session and $20 for completing the Session 2) as soon as we receive the samples back through the mail.</em></p>
<p><em>Here are some things to keep in mind:</em></p>
<p><em>You are a volunteer in this study, which means you do not have to do anything, or say anything, that makes you uncomfortable. We would like you to try everything you can, and to do your best, but if there are things you absolutely do not want to do, just tells us, that is o.k.</em></p>
<p><em>Another thing we want to remind you is that nothing you do today is a TEST!! We want you to try your best, but there is no “right” or “wrong” answers in anything you do today. We just want to learn about you!</em></p>
<p><em>We will keep your participation confidential. You are given an ID number in order to keep your data confidential and separated from your name. Therefore, any identifying information (like your name, email, address, etc.) will be kept private and not paired with your data. We will also use a secondary ID number to save the videos with (since your faces are in it), which will help separate this from your name and the other data we collect form you. Only members of our research team will have access to your name and ID numbers.</em></p>
<p><em>I will rename your “ZOOM Name” right now with your Secondary ID number, to prepare for the recordings we will take in our session today</em></p>
<p>[Researcher will rename the participant’s name to “P” for participant. <img src="images/zoom_parent_child_interaction/1.png" alt="" /></p>
<p><em>Ok- I will now send you a link through the Zoom chat, which will open up a survey that allows you to virtually indicate your consent to participate in the study. Please feel free to take your time reading through the consent and assent forms now if you’d like. As I mentioned earlier, these are the documents we had previously sent you in the emails leading up to today’s session.</em></p>
<p>[Then once they are done reading through]</p>
<p><em>All set and any questions?</em></p>
<p>[IF NO,] <em>Please click to indicate yours and your child’s consent/assent and verbally let us know each of the items you have consented/not consented for, so we can adjust the session in case there is something you/your child may not feel up for today!</em></p>
<p><em>You may press submit once you are finished to “send in the form.”</em></p>
<p>Researcher to grab magic box.</p>
<p><em>Once you are all set with that, we’d like you for to grab the magic box we sent you in the mail. This contains everything you will need for today’s session and what you will do as apart of Session 2 as well.</em></p>
<p><em>If you haven’t already done so, please open the magic box up. The magic box should contain a sheet of paper at the top which details all of the contents, but we will let you know when you need to take each item out of the box. Please set aside the magic box for now but keep the materials near you as we may need to access materials from the magic box throughout today’s session!</em></p>
<p><em>What you can pull out now and use throughout the session is the Reward Board and Gold Star Stickers. Use this reward board to track all the steps you accomplish today! Each space is like each task for the session. Once you complete the task you can put a gold star on the space!</em></p>
<p><em>Are you ready to get started on the session? Great, lets dive in!</em></p>

</div>
<div id="protocol---parent-child-observation-online" class="section level3">
<h3>Protocol - Parent Child Observation Online</h3>
<p>The parent and child will be seated together in view on the Zoom camera. During that time they will be filmed while solving a conflict, and then again while discussing a pleasant event. The conflict event will always go first, followed by the pleasant event. We did this to ensure that the parents were not thinking of the negative interaction upon answering the questionnaires about their child, which they did immediately after the observation interaction.</p>
<p>[RESEARCHER SHOULD ASSESS VOLUME. If participant volume is too low, recording will not pick it up. Ensure that volume is at an appropriate frequency before proceeding to PC interaction recordings.]</p>
<p>[RESEARCHER SHOULD CHANGE TO SPEAKER VIEW. Participants should be in speaker view so recording will enlarge the parent and child for behavior analysis.]</p>
<p>Step 1:
The researcher will ask the parent to find the <a href="https://ucla.app.box.com/file/630327764749">Pleasant/Unpleasant Events Checklist</a> piece of paper from their session package.</p>
<p><em>Researcher: So the first thing we will have you pull out of the magic box is the paper packet titled “Online Session Booklet.” You can flip to the page that says “Pleasant Events and Issues Checklist.”</em></p>
<p>Researcher will wait for the participant to find the Online Session Booklet and flip to the correct page.</p>
<p><em>Researcher: Next we are going to take some film of you while you discuss something that’s hard and try to resolve it. On this piece of paper (Issues Cheklist) is a list of things that parents and children sometimes have disagreements about. We will give you a moment to read the list and think about some that you would like to discuss together. Then after about one minute, you will start discussing the things you have selected and try to resolve them. You do not need to tell us what you chose to discuss, and it does not matter if you chose something from this list, or decide to choose something else. And we want you to remember- this is not a test and there are no right or wrong things to say!</em></p>
<p><em>I am going to turn off my camera and mute myself to be out of the recording, and I will also step out of the room and will not be listening in. I will come back in and let you know when the six minutes are all done!</em></p>
<p><em>When you are ready, I will begin the recording and give you a total of 6 minutes- one minute or so to choose, then five mimnutes to discuss! Are you ready?</em></p>
<p>Step 2:
- Researcher will ensure Zoom security settings are set up for the video.
- Parent and child will be situated side-by-side in view on the Zoom camera.
-Researcher will press record on the Zoom application. <img src="images/zoom_parent_child_interaction/3.png" alt="" /> Wait to hear the audio Zoom confirmation <em>“this meeting is now being recorded”</em> and view recording in progress at top left of screen to ensure recording is live. <img src="images/zoom_parent_child_interaction/4.png" alt="" />
- Researcher set timer for 6 minute1</p>
<p>Step 3:
- Researcher will mute themselves on Zoom and turn off their camera, and step out of the room.
- Researcher will start timer for 6 minutes. At the end of 6 minutes, reenter camera view and unmute themselves.</p>
<p>[After 5 minutes have passed, say] <em>Thank you for taking the time to discuss something difficult. Next we are going to take some film of you talking about something nice. On your “Pleasant Events Checklist” is a list of fun things that parents and children sometimes do together. I will give you a moment to read the list and pick something that you would like to plan to do together. Then after about one minute, you will start discussing the things you have selected and try to plan them. Again, you do not need to tell us what you chose to discuss, and it does not matter if you choose something from this list, or decide to choose something else. When you are ready, I will start the recording and then give you a minute to choose and five minutes to discuss!</em></p>
<p><em>I will be give you six minutes in total, one minute to choose and 5 minutes to discuss- remember, try to plan whatever fun thing you talk about during those five minutes. After, I will come back into the video call and give you further instructions. Do you have any questions?</em></p>
<p>If no questions, proceed.</p>
<p>Step 5:
- Researcher will start timer for 6 minutes.</p>
<p>Step 6:
- After six minutes, researcher reenters the room and back into camera view, turns up volume on the computer, and stops the recording on Zoom. <img src="images/zoom_parent_child_interaction/5.png" alt="" /> You will view this notification in the upper right hand corner that states the recorded file will be converted to mp4 once the meeting ends. <img src="images/zoom_parent_child_interaction/6.png" alt="" /> Move the child/adolescent and parent onto the next task in the session, as the video will not be saved until after the session is complete.</p>

<p><em>Now we are done with the group activity. You can go ahead and take out your token board and gold star stickers, and stick one golden star on the first block, where the movie icon is!</em></p>
<p><em>Next we will move on to some individual activities, where Mom/Dad will complete some surveys while you [Child’s name] plays a computer game. The computer game is about your child’s learning and memory so it is important they dont get help from you! We actually prefer you don’t watch the screen so you dont know which pictures they see. If you recall the example from our powerpoint at the beginning of this session, this will be the time that your child will see some pictures on the screen</em></p>
<p><em>I will now just give [Child’s name] some instructions on the computer game. Let me share my screen so I can show you some examples!</em></p>
<p>[Researcher to open up the <a href="https://ucla.app.box.com/file/709481066655">halloween_training</a>]</p>

The places you will be visiting are houses that either have a toy or a candy. Your job is to do their best to remember what toy or candy is with what house.</em></p>
<p><em>Here are some examples of what you might see</em></p>
<p><em>Sometimes you will get a toy while other times you will get a candy, and sometimes you will be visiting a nice house while other times you will be visiting a scary one. Remember that the type of toy or candy will vary and where it is found will differ. You will only be shown the photos for a few seconds, so do your best to memorize these details as quickly and as much as possible!</em></p>
<p><em>We also want to make sure you are paying attention, so when you see this red triangle, we want you to hit the space bar!</em></p>
<p><em>You will be reaching a halfway point where you can just click “continue”</em></p>
<p><em>There are TWO PARTS to this game- we are only going to be doing PART 1 right now. So, it is super important that when you see the page that says you’re finished with this part, PLEASE LET ME KNOW!!</em></p>
<p>[Researcher to stop sharing screen.]</p>
<p><em>So to get your child setup for the computer game, we will send you a link through the Zoom chat now. Let me know once the link has loaded.</em></p>

<ul>
<li>1 sheet of aluminum foil (provided)</li>
<li>1 small ziplock bag with participant ID (provided)</li>
<li>Painter-tape (provided)</li>
<li>1 scissor (salon grade if they have)</li>

<li>Researcher set up the following materials (to help explain hair sample collection):
<ul>
<li>1 sheet of aluminum foil</li>
<li>1 small ziplock bag with participant ID</li>
<li>1 salon grade scissor</li>
<li>1 rattail comb</li>
<li>Painter-tape</li>
<li>2 alligator curl clips</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
</div>
<div id="explanation" class="section level4">
<h4>Explanation</h4>
<ul>
<li>Refer to the instructions booklet included in the participant’s magic box, found here: <a href="https://ucla.app.box.com/file/739671629603">hair_sample_collection_instructions</a></li>
<li>Tell the parent that you will go over it verbally with them BEFORE they should start collecting the sample.</li>
<li>Explain to both the child and parent that they will be collecting 30-50 strands of hair. The amount of hair to be collected is less hair than is lost in normal everyday-brushing from the back of the head. Show them the amount on your own head.</li>
<li>Inform them how the site for the sampling is hidden by the surrounding hair, therefore not visible after collection.</li>
<li>Explain how the sample is used to measure a hormone called cortisol that is present in the hair.</li>
<li>Show on the hair sample picture directions sheet the hair sample taken from the wig to illustrate the amount of hair that will be collected (30-50 strands).</li>
<li>Offer to show our hair sample collection video if the parent would like a more comprehensive visual.</li>
<li>After taking the sample, the parent will tape it to the aluminum foil. When doing this, it is VERY important to place the tape at least 3cm below the root end. To show the parent how long 3cm is, you can use the measuring tape provided, or tell them it is 1.5 inches (really closer to 4cm but better longer than shorter).</li>
<li>If hair kit included painters tape, ensure that at least 3 cm of root is above the painters tape, and that the tape does NOT cover the root. If hair is shorter than 3cm, instruct not to use the tape.</li>
<li>If hair kit included rubber band, ensure that rubber band is put on hair PRIOR to cutting. The rubber hand then helps secure the bunched hair in the foil after hair sample is taken.</li>
<li>When they are ready to package the hair sample, ensure that the foil does not fold at the root- this is a very sensitive area in which we are analyzing, and important not to damage!</li>
<li>When finished, hair sample should be put in the foil, in the ziploc bag, in the white box along with the other samples</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div id="hair-length-1" class="section level4">
<h4>Hair Length</h4>
<ul>
<li>For short hair (less than or just above 3cm, i.e., too short to tape and still have 3cm usable), follow the Short-Hair Protocol below.</li>
<li>For longer hair (&gt;3cm), follow the Longer-Hair Protocol below.</li>
<li>Ideally, hair samples should be at least 3cm long. If the hair is less than 1cm long, the sample cannot be used.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Short-Hair Protocol (1-3cm)- advise parent to:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Select a portion of hair from the posterior vertex of the head (in line with ears is a good reference point).</li>
<li>Use the rattail comb to thin out the hair as much as possible, so that the parent is grasping a horizontal line of hair rather than a chunk.</li>
<li>Ensure that 30-50 strands are included in the portion being held.</li>
<li>Hold the loose hair tightly with index finger and thumb, and cut the hair along the part, as close to the scalp and as evenly as possible.</li>
<li>Place loose hairs in foil and fold it securely. Do NOT tape the hair to the foil.</li>
<li>Fold the foil without bending the hair, and ensure that the hair does not fall out of the foil.</li>
<li>Ensure the root-end on the aluminum foil is labeled and place it in the ziplock bag.</li>
<li>Ensure the ziplock bag is labeled with the participant’s ID and Wave.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Longer-Hair Protocol (&gt;3 cm) - advise parent to:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Take the comb and part the hair horizontally between the tips of the ears.</li>
<li>Take a clip to clip away the hair from the top of the parting.</li>
<li>Instruct the parent to grasp approx. 30-50 strands of hair under the hair that has been clipped up.</li>
<li>Use the rattail comb to thin out the hair as much as possible, so that the parent is grasping a horizontal line of hair rather than a chunk. After this step, ensure the parent is still grasping 30-50 strands.</li>
<li>Instruct the parent to cut the hair sample as close to the scalp as possible.</li>
<li>Attach the hair to the center of the aluminum foil by taping with painter’s tape - leave at least 3 cm of hair from the root end; not cover the root end.</li>
<li>If parent does not know how much 3cm is, you can: say that they can measure it with the cm side of the measuring tape; if they know inches say it is about 1.5 inches (really closer to 4cm but better too long than too short); or offer to demonstrate based on the length of your own finger.</li>
<li>Place the hair inside the aluminum foil in the orientation indicated by the “root” written on the foil.</li>
<li>Fold the foil without bending the hair, and ensure that the hair does not fall out of the foil.</li>
<li>Place the folded foil in the ziplock bag.</li>
<li>Put the ziploc bag back in the magic box.</li>
</ul>
<p><em>Now we are all done with the hair sample! You can go ahead and put another star on your token board!</em></p>

<h3>Protocol - Storing Stool Sample</h3>
<div id="sample-quality-1" class="section level4">
<h4>Sample Quality</h4>
<ul>
<li>Put on gloves.</li>
<li>Open the mailer to ensure that it contains both the stool sample (in biohazard bag) and the Bristol Stool Scale.</li>
<li>Check for quality of the stool sample by shaking it up and down vigorously (keep the sample in the biohazard bag), then check for its consistency and color - It should be a dark-brown liquid.</li>
<li>If stool sample does not meet requirement (e.g. sample is in solid form or amount collected is too little), contact the family to see if they would be willing to send another sample with compensation.</li>
<li>Contact family if the Bristol Stool Scale is missing in the mailer.</li>
</ul>

<div id="sample-transfer-1" class="section level4">
<h4>Sample Transfer</h4>
<ul>
<li>Wear appropriate PPE:
<ul>
<li>Gloves</li>
<li>Lab coat</li>
<li>Safety glasses</li>
<li>Surgical Mask</li>
<li>Closed-toe shoes</li>
<li>Long pants</li>

<li>Drape</li>
<li>2.0mL cryogenic vials</li>
<li>Stool samples in biohazard bag</li>
<li>Test tube racks</li>
<li>Transport box with divider</li>
<li>Sharpie for labeling</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Steps:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Lay a new drape on the work station and keep all equipments and sample on the drape throughout the transfer process.</li>
<li>With the stool sample collection vial still in the biohazard bag, shake it up and down vigorously.</li>
<li>Take the stool sample out of the bag and put it on the test tube rack.</li>
<li>Untwist two 2.0mL vials and place them on the test tube rack.</li>
<li>Untwist the stool sample collection vial, and carefully pour the sample into the first 2.0mL vial. (It’s okay if the ball does or does not get transferred)</li>
<li>Stop pouring when solution reached the 1.8mL line to prevent overflow, and pour the remaining sample (if any) in a second 2.0mL vial.</li>
<li>Cap the 2.0mL vials tightly to prevent spills.</li>
<li>Label the 2.0mL vials with a sharpie, ensure it has the participant ID and Wave and vial number.</li>
<li>Place the labeled 2.0mL vials in the transport box with divider.</li>
<li>Close the now-empty stool sample collection vial, put it back in the biohazard bag, and dispose it in the biohazard waste bin.</li>
<li>Clean up work station, dispose the drape, and wipe down the table top with disinfectant wipe.</li>
<li>Remove PPE and wash hands with soap and water thoroughly.</li>
<li>Bring the transport box to C454 where the -80˚C freezer is located (key in BABLab Lock Box).</li>
<li>Place the 2.0mL vials in their designated space in the freezer box (in accordance to the Sample Storage Log Diagram).</li>
<li>Log the sample in the <a href="https://app.box.com/file/630322897864">Sample Storage Log</a>.</li>
