If no ASA nutrition report has been generated, delete page 3 of the pdf. Navigate to the last pge of the pdf, and fill in the scores for this participant. You can type directly on the page - it is a fillable form. After you have entered the data, it should look like this If there are any comments, enter them on the comments page. For example, if any NA’s are present due to less than 70% of data for that subset being available to calculate a score - note that here. Or, for example if the child was too young to receive a grade based score, you could note the aged based reading of the table here. If there are no comments, delete this page. Important - Once you have completed the edits to the pdf, you must follow these steps to “lock” the data so that it is no longer editable before sending to the participant. To do so, click file/print/PDF/Save as PDF. Save the PDF to your desktop, then replace the original PDF with the desktop version. The report card is now ready to be sent to the participant. "],
["protocols.html", "Section 3 Protocols 3.1 Consent 3.2 Recruitment 3.3 Addressing Concerns", " Section 3 Protocols 3.1 Consent Once the parent and child come into the lab, seat them in the rainbow room on the couch for consenting. Make some small talk - Ask the participant how they got here. If they have participated before in research. Offer them a bottle of water. Thank them for coming and for giving up their weekend to help science. Tell the parent and child that the first thing you are going to do is go over all of the things they will do today, and have them sign the consent forms. Speak to them and direct them through the whole process. 3.1.1 Things you will do in the lab Stick stickers on you to measure heart rate, sweat, stomach muscles. Sit with parent and talk about fun things and hard things (filming). Parent stays in room and answers more questions. Child goes next door to play computer games (look at pictures, watch movies). Some of the movies and pictures will be a little bit scary, others sad, others boring. One of the games involves a loud annoying noise, we will adjust it for you. You will also do some other games on paper and pencil - like puzzle and word games You will answer some questionnaires We will also measure your height, weight, and waist circumference. We will take three biological samples: Hair - stress hormones Saliva - microbiome Blood - immune - wear goggles Do you get sick or dizzy when you see blood or hurt yourself? If we need to, can we prick two fingers? When you are done with all of that, you will get a big prize, then we will pay you and you will go home. You will get $45 for the work you put in today. 3.1.2 Things you will do at home Child Poop sample - microbiome Stool scale Memory game - to see what you remember from lab. Parent 24 hour food recall When you complete the poop sample and the games at home, we will pay you another $20 in the form of a giftcard. 3.1.3 Things to know You are a volunteer, which means that you do not have to do anything, or say anything that makes you uncomfortable. We would like you to try everything you can, and to do your best, but if there are things you absolutely do not want to do, just tell us, that is o.k.
