Once the parent and child/teen come into the lab, seat them in the Rainbow Room on the couch for consenting (parent) and assenting (child aged 7+ or teen).

Make some small talk - Ask the participant how they got here. If they have participated before in research. Offer them a bottle of water. Thank them for coming and for giving up their weekend to help science.

Tell the parent and child that the first thing you are going to do is go over all of the things they will do today, and have them sign the consent and assent forms.

Speak to them and direct them through the whole process.

\item
  Sit with parent and talk about fun things and hard things (filming).

  Parent stays in room and answers more questions.
\item
  Child goes next door to play computer games (look at pictures, watch movies). Some of the movies and pictures will be a little bit scary, others sad, others boring.
\item
  One of the games involves a loud annoying noise, we will adjust it for you.
\item
  You will also do some other games on paper and pencil - like puzzle and word games
\item
  You will answer some questionnaires
\item
  We will also measure your height, weight, and waist circumference.
\item
  We will take three biological samples:

  \begin{itemize}
  \tightlist
  \item
    Hair - stress hormones
  \item
    Saliva - microbiome
  \item
    Blood - immune - wear goggles

  Do you get sick or dizzy when you see blood or hurt yourself?
\item
  If we need to, can we prick two fingers?
\item
  When you are done with all of that, you will get a big prize, then we will pay you and you will go home.

You are a volunteer, which means that you do not have to do anything, or say anything that makes you uncomfortable. We would like you to try everything you can, and to do your best, but if there are things you absolutely do not want to do, just tell us, that is o.k.

We keep your participation confidential - ID number.

We want you to come in again in the future, so we will ask for some information so we can contact you in the future.

\subsection{Parent/Child Observation}\label{parentchild-observation}}

The parent and child will be in the Rainbow Room for 15 minutes. During that time they will be filmed while planning a conflict event, and then again while discussing a pleasant event. The conflict event will always go first, followed by the pleasant event. We did this to ensure that the parents were not thinking of the negative interaction upon answering the questionnaires about their child, which they did immediately after the observation interaction. If participants indicate that they prefer to speak in a language other than English, they may do so.

\textbf{Step 1}:

Parent and child will be situated on the grey couch in the Rainbow Room. The iPad video camera will be placed about 4 feet away from the dyad, on a tripod stand. The screen of the iPad will be facing away from the parent and child.

\begin{figure}
\centering
\includegraphics{images/parent:child_obser/2.png}
\caption{}
\end{figure}

\textbf{Step 2}:

The researcher will give the parent and child the Pleasant Events Checklist (PEC) on a piece of paper.

\emph{Researcher: Next we are going to take some film of you while you discuss a source of conflict (or something you disagree on). On this piece of paper is a list of things that parents and children sometimes have disagreements about. Please take a moment to read the list and think about some that you would like to discuss together. When I knock on the door, please start discussing the things you have selected from the list. You do not need to tell us what you chose to discuss, and it does not matter if you chose something from the list, or decide to choose something else not included on the list.I will give you five minutes to discuss the event, then I will come back and give you further instructions.}

\textbf{Step 3}:

Researcher press record on the iPad and leave the room. Start timer for 1 minute, then knock on the door and ask the dyad to begin discussing their event. Start timer for 5 minutes. At the end of 5 minutes, again knock on the door and enter the Rainbow Room.

\emph{Researcher: Thank you for taking the time to discuss the source of conflict. Next we are going to take some film of you while you discuss a pleasant event you could do together. On this piece of paper is a list of events that parents and children sometimes find pleasant to do together. Please take a moment to read the list of events and think about what you would like to plan to do together. When I knock on the door, please start discussing the event you would like to do together and make a plan for how you could do it. You do not need to tell us what you chose to discuss, and it does not matter if you chose something from the list, or decide to choose something else not included on the list. I will give you five minutes to discuss the event, then I will come back and give you further instructions.}

\textbf{Step 4}:

Researcher press record on the iPad and leave the room. Start timer for 1 minute, then knock on the door and ask the dyad to begin discussing their event. Start timer for 5 minutes. At the end of 5 minutes, again knock on the door and enter the Rainbow Room.

\textbf{Step 5}:

Researcher reenter the room, switch the iPad off and move the child/adolescent to their next session.

\subsubsection{Coding the Interview}\label{coding-the-interview}}

\begin{itemize}
\item
  After the interviews are collected, videos will be coded by two observers blind to the caregiving group of the child (adversity or comparison).
\item
  Our original plan was to follow the LIFE coding system developed by Hops:

  \begin{itemize}
  \tightlist
  \item
    Hops H, Davis B, Longoria N. Methodological issues in direct observation -- Illustrations with the Living in Familial Environments (LIFE) coding system. Journal of Clinical Child Psychology. 1995;24:193--203. \href{https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1207/s15374424jccp2402_7?journalCode=hcap19}{Google Scholar}
  \end{itemize}
\item
  However, this system is prohibitively expensive and very training intensive. Instead we decided to go with either of the following two coding schedules:

  \begin{itemize}
  \item
    \begin{enumerate}
    \def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
    \tightlist
    \item
      Family Interaction Macrocoding Schedule (FIMS) Holmbeck, Zebracki, Johnson, Belvedere, \& Hommeyer, 2007.
    \end{enumerate}
  \item
    \begin{enumerate}
    \def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
    \setcounter{enumi}{1}
    \tightlist
    \item
      CIB Training with Ruth Feldman.
    \end{enumerate}
  \end{itemize}
\item
  We ultimately decided to go with FIMS for several reasons:

  \begin{itemize}
  \tightlist
  \item
    Expense - Sarah Whittle paid approximately \$ 1000USD for a 10 hour skype training session with one of Holmbeck's team), whereas CIB training is /\$2500 and also involves flights and accommodation at Yale.
  \item
    Validation in age range - I like CIB for younger children, but FIMS was designed for older children and adolescents, and Sarah Whittle has validated it in a community sample of 8 year olds and their mothers.
  \item
    FIMS is a less intensive coding schedule, producing global codes, rather than micro coded (i.e., minute to minute) scales - which makes more intuitive sense in the age range for MBB.
  \item
    FIMS has a peer version that we might brach out to in the future (but likely not needing further training): \url{https://psycnet.apa.org/record/2014-24011-001}
  \item
    Sarah Whittle's group looked at the component structure for the FIMS and found components that seemed close to what they were finding with the Hops LIFE system - namely: negative maternal affect during pleasant event, negative maternal during conflict discussion, and pleasant maternal affect across both tasks (warmth). The negative maternal during pleasant event was the most predictive of child behavior problems. Overall, the correlations they report in their paper are all very sensical and convinced me that we should use the FIMS. \url{https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/full/10.1177/1073191118796557}

\item
  Wrap medical tape around these to secure them, but ensure that the metal poles are still accessible
\item
  Look at the skeleton diagram and use the EL-PREP Gel to abrade the skin around the remaining electrode sites (below the collarbones, below the sternum, on the left lower ribs, and in the remaining two positions on the stomach and left ribs)
\item
  Clean the remaining EL-PREP off with a tissue or baby wipe

  Simultaneously press play on the movie on the laptop while also pressing the spacebar on the psychopy task. This will start the physiology and the movie at about the same time. While the movie is playing there will be a box of popcorn on the computer screen.
\item
  When the movie is done, press spacebar on the psychopy computer to progress to the next screen. Read the instructions for the participant:
\item
  Click on the face that shows how you feel after watching the movies.
\item
  Participants can use a mouse to click on the face that matches the way they feel after watching the movie. The faces range in valence (negative to positive) across the X axis, and arousal (low to high) up the Y axis.
\item
  After the participant has selected a face, you will be taken to the next screen where you can read the instructions for the participants:

  \emph{Listen to the list of words and try to remember all of them.}
\item
  When the participant indicates that they have understood the instructions, press the spacebar and progress to the next screen. Make sure that the computer volume is up and the participant can hear the words being pronounced on the computer screen. After the participant hears all the words the distractor task will start.
\item
  Read the distractor task instructions to the participant:

  \emph{Count backwards from the number 25 out loud for the researcher.}
\end{itemize}

\textbf{Note: Whether the participant completes the distractor task correctly or not doesn't matter. The only purpose of the distractor task is to distract the participant for a brief period of time. Listen while they count backwards. If they can't count backwards, ask them to count forwards.}

\begin{itemize}
\item
  When the participant is finished counting backwards from 25, or after approximately 30s has passed (whatever comes first), progress to the next screen by pressing the spacebar.
\item
  Read the instructions out loud to the participant:

  \emph{Recall 1. Please tell the researcher all the words that you can remember from the list.}
\item
  Before the participant starts to tell you what they remember, start a new voice recording and then tell them to start while you record what they say (on the talk setting). Also write what they say on a piece of paper. Make sure to note that this is `Recall 1' (as there is a second recall later on). When the participant has told you all the words they can remember, or after 60s, progress to the next screen (instructions for the next word list).
\item
  Make one recording for all of the memory intrusion task
\item
  Read the instructions aloud for the participant.

  \emph{Now you will hear another word list. Get ready!}
\item
  Press the spacebar to hear the word list. After the word list, move to the distractor task (counting backwards from 25). After the distractor task, move to the second recall task and record the participant like the first. When the second recall task is complete, a new loop will begin. Read the instructions to the participant then start the next movie (which will always be neutral). Repeat everything again for the final loop after they watch the final movie, which will either be sad or scary.
\item
  Physiology Marks:

  \begin{itemize}
  \tightlist
  \item
    We have inserted start and stop times for the physiology for the movie component of the task, which will be used for one of the analyses. We have also inserted physiology marks for the start and stop times for each of the word lists, and finally for the recall phases. Note: be careful using physiology during the recall phase, as the participant is talking during that phase.
