The Mind, Brain, Body study looks at how early caregiving experiences influence the emotional, cognitive, and brain development, as well as physical health and wellness.

The study also explores how the bacteria that live inside us (the microbiome) are connected to the development of our brains and bodies.

\subsubsection{Coding the Observation}\label{coding-the-observation}}

\begin{itemize}
\item
  After the observation are collected, videos will be coded by two observers blind to the caregiving group of the child (adversity or comparison).
\item
  Our original plan was to follow the LIFE coding system developed by Hops:

  \begin{itemize}
  \tightlist
  \item
    Hops H, Davis B, Longoria N. Methodological issues in direct observation -- Illustrations with the Living in Familial Environments (LIFE) coding system. Journal of Clinical Child Psychology. 1995;24:193--203. \href{https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1207/s15374424jccp2402_7?journalCode=hcap19}{Google Scholar}
  \end{itemize}
\item
  However, this system is prohibitively expensive and very training intensive. Instead we decided to go with either of the following two coding schedules:

  \begin{itemize}
  \item
    \begin{enumerate}
    \def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
    \tightlist
    \item
      Family Interaction Macrocoding Schedule (FIMS) Holmbeck, Zebracki, Johnson, Belvedere, \& Hommeyer, 2007.
    \end{enumerate}
  \item
    \begin{enumerate}
    \def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
    \setcounter{enumi}{1}
    \tightlist
    \item
      CIB Training with Ruth Feldman.
    \end{enumerate}
  \end{itemize}
\item
  We ultimately decided to go with FIMS for several reasons:

  \begin{itemize}
  \tightlist
  \item
    Expense - Sarah Whittle paid approximately \$ 1000USD for a 10 hour skype training session with one of Holmbeck's team), whereas CIB training is /\$2500 and also involves flights and accommodation at Yale.
  \item
    Validation in age range - I like CIB for younger children, but FIMS was designed for older children and adolescents, and Sarah Whittle has validated it in a community sample of 8 year olds and their mothers.
  \item
    FIMS is a less intensive coding schedule, producing global codes, rather than micro coded (i.e., minute to minute) scales - which makes more intuitive sense in the age range for MBB.
  \item
    FIMS has a peer version that we might brach out to in the future (but likely not needing further training): \url{https://psycnet.apa.org/record/2014-24011-001}
  \item
    Sarah Whittle's group looked at the component structure for the FIMS and found components that seemed close to what they were finding with the Hops LIFE system - namely: negative maternal affect during pleasant event, negative maternal during conflict discussion, and pleasant maternal affect across both tasks (warmth). The negative maternal during pleasant event was the most predictive of child behavior problems. Overall, the correlations they report in their paper are all very sensical and convinced me that we should use the FIMS. \url{https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/full/10.1177/1073191118796557}

  Physiology Marks:

  \begin{itemize}

  \item
    We have inserted start and stop times for the physiology for the movie component of the task, which will be used for one of the analyses. We have also inserted physiology marks for the start and stop times for each of the word lists, and finally for the recall phases. Note: be careful using physiology during the recall phase, as the participant is talking during that phase.

Once the parent and child/teen come into the lab, seat them in the Rainbow Room on the couch for consenting (parent) and assenting (child aged 7+ or teen).

Make some small talk - Ask the participant how they got here. If they have participated before in research. Offer them a bottle of water. Thank them for coming and for giving up their weekend to help science.

Tell the parent and child that the first thing you are going to do is go over all of the things they will do today, and have them sign the consent and assent forms.

Speak to them and direct them through the whole process.

\subsection{Protocol - Parent/Child Observation}\label{protocol---parentchild-observation}}

The parent and child will be in the Rainbow Room for 15 minutes. During that time they will be filmed while planning a conflict event, and then again while discussing a pleasant event. The conflict event will always go first, followed by the pleasant event. We did this to ensure that the parents were not thinking of the negative interaction upon answering the questionnaires about their child, which they did immediately after the observation interaction. If participants indicate that they prefer to speak in a language other than English, they may do so.

\textbf{Step 1}:

Parent and child will be situated on the grey couch in the Rainbow Room. The iPad video camera will be placed about 4 feet away from the dyad, on a tripod stand. The screen of the iPad will be facing away from the parent and child.

\begin{figure}
\centering
\includegraphics{images/parent:child_obser/2.png}
\caption{}
\end{figure}

\textbf{Step 2}:

The researcher will give the parent and child the Pleasant Events Checklist (PEC) on a piece of paper.

\emph{Researcher: Next we are going to take some film of you while you discuss a source of conflict (or something you disagree on) and try to resolve it. On this piece of paper is a list of things that parents and children sometimes have disagreements about. Please take a moment to read the list and think about some that you would like to discuss together. When I knock on the door, please start discussing the things you have selected from the list and try to resolve the areas of conflict you have chosen from the list. You do not need to tell us what you chose to discuss, and it does not matter if you chose something from the list, or decide to choose something else not included on the list. I will give you five minutes to discuss the event, then I will come back and give you further instructions.}

\textbf{Step 3}:

Researcher press record on the iPad and leave the room. Start timer for 1 minute, then knock on the door and ask the dyad to begin discussing their event. Start timer for 5 minutes. At the end of 5 minutes, again knock on the door and enter the Rainbow Room.

\emph{Researcher: Thank you for taking the time to discuss the source of conflict and try to resolve it. Next we are going to take some film of you while you discuss a pleasant event you could do together. On this piece of paper is a list of events that parents and children sometimes find pleasant to do together. Please take a moment to read the list of events and think about what you would like to plan to do together. When I knock on the door, please start discussing the event you would like to do together and make a plan for how you could do it. You do not need to tell us what you chose to discuss, and it does not matter if you chose something from the list, or decide to choose something else not included on the list.

  Read the distractor task instructions to the participant:

  \emph{Count backwards from the number 25 out loud for the researcher.}
\end{itemize}

\textbf{Note: Whether the participant completes the distractor task correctly or not doesn't matter. The only purpose of the distractor task is to distract the participant for a brief period of time. Listen while they count backwards. If they can't count backwards, ask them to count forwards.}

\begin{itemize}
\item
  When the participant is finished counting backwards from 25, or after approximately 30s has passed (whatever comes first), progress to the next screen by pressing the spacebar.
\item
  Read the instructions out loud to the participant:

  \emph{Recall 1. Please tell the researcher all the words that you can remember from the list.}
\item
  Before the participant starts to tell you what they remember, start a new voice recording and then tell them to start while you record what they say (on the talk setting). Also write what they say on a piece of paper. Make sure to note that this is `Recall 1' (as there is a second recall later on). When the participant has told you all the words they can remember, or after 60s, progress to the next screen (instructions for the next word list).
\item
  Make one recording for all of the memory intrusion task
\item
  Read the instructions aloud for the participant.

  \emph{Now you will hear another word list. Get ready!}
\item
  Press the spacebar to hear the word list. After the word list, move to the distractor task (counting backwards from 25). After the distractor task, move to the second recall task and record the participant like the first. When the second recall task is complete, a new loop will begin. Read the instructions to the participant then start the next movie (which will always be neutral). Repeat everything again for the final loop after they watch the final movie, which will either be sad or scary.

{[}ONCE ZOOM IS CONNECTED{]}

\emph{Hi! Thank you so much for joining us today! We are so looking forward to today's session with you. Usually, when we conduct a study such as this, we would do it our lab at UCLA. However, with COVID-19 we've decided it would be safer to carry out this study online for the time being- social distancing and all!}

\emph{Our session today should take around 1 hour long. In addition to what we do here today, there will be a follow up zoom appointment with us one week from now. At that appointment, we will reconnect on a second Zoom call in which your child will log on for 10 minutes and complete a computer game.}

\emph{Sounds good? Let's get started!}

{[}Researcher to open up the \href{https://ucla.app.box.com/file/689404174873}{MBB\_Consent\_Script\_Presentation}{]}

\emph{First thing we are going to do is go over what is on the consent and assent forms. (These are the attached documents we sent you in the emails leading up to this session.) We will walk through, in a little bit more detail, all of the things we will be doing during today's session.}

\emph{During today's online session we are going to be doing some interactive things. First, we are going to have you and your parent sit and talk about some fun things and some not so fun things while on ZOOM. This conversation will be recorded but we will not be watching or listening in, you and your parent will be ``virtually alone.''}

\emph{Next, we are going to have you play a game on the computer. In this game, you will be looking at pictures. Some of the pictures will be a bit scary, some sad, others a bit boring. While you are playing this game, your parent will stay with you in the room but will be working on some surveys to fill out.}

\emph{After the game is over, your parent {[}NAME{]} will help measure your height, weight, and waist circumference.}

\emph{You will also be answering some surveys (for children) with the researcher OR (for teens) on your own.}

\emph{Lastly for today, your parent will help take two biological samples during this session.}

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
\tightlist
\item
  One is the hair sample which helps measure hormones that everyone has in their hair
\item
  Two is the saliva sample which helps tell us learn a little bit more about your microbiome
\end{enumerate}

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  Do you know what a microbiome is?
\item
  A microbiome is all the little bacteria that live inside your mouth. Everyone has these, they are healthy! We just want to know what kind and how many of each there are.
\end{itemize}

\emph{For helping us out in today's session, you will be getting \$45 for the work you put in! After this online session is over, we'll ask you to do three more things at home:}

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
\tightlist
\item
  One is the Child poop sample -- this helps us learn a bit more about your microbiome
\end{enumerate}

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  There are also little bacteria that live in your tummy! Everyone has these and we want to know more about them.
\end{itemize}

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
\setcounter{enumi}{1}
\tightlist
\item
  Two is filling out the stool scale -- this is a short scale that gives a description of your sample
\item
  Three is the computer memory game -- this is when you will log back on with us via ZOOM in a week's time to see what you remember from today's session
\end{enumerate}

\emph{Great! Do you have any questions for us about any of the samples}

\emph{When you complete the poop sample and the computer game at home, we will pay you another \$20!}

\emph{We will send the full payment of \$65 (\$45 for today's session and \$20 for completing the home session) as soon as we receive the samples back through the mail.}

\emph{Here are some things to keep in mind:}

\emph{You are a volunteer in this study, which means you do not have to do anything, or say anything, that makes you uncomfortable. We would like you to try everything you can, and to do your best, but if there are things you absolutely do not want to do, just tells us, that is o.k.}

\emph{We will keep your participation confidential. You are given an ID number in order to keep your data confidential and separated from your name. Therefore, any identifying information (like your name, email, address, etc.) will be kept private and not paired with your data. We will also use a secondary ID number to save the videos with (since your faces are in it), which will help separate this from your name and the other data we collect form you. Only members of our research team will have access to your name and ID numbers.}

\emph{As this is a longitudinal study, and we want you to come again in the future if you are interested, we will ask for some information so that we may reach out to you in the future. As I mentioned earlier, we sent you an email with a bunch of links that would be used in the session today. Please go there and click on the first one, which will allow you to virtually indicate your consent to participate in the study. If you'd like,you can share your screen with us now and we can walk you through it. Once you get that pulled up, you will see the consent/assent documents attached there as well- please feel free to take your time reading through the consent and assent forms now if you'd like.}

{[}Then once they are done reading through{]}

\emph{All set and any questions?}

{[}IF NO,{]} \emph{Please click to indicate your consent/assent and submit the REDCap form. You may press submit once you are finished to ``send in the form.''}

Researcher to grab magic box.

\emph{Once you are all set with that, we'd like you for to grab the magic box we sent you in the mail. This contains everything you will need for today's session and what you will do at home after today's session.}

\emph{The magic box should contain a sheet of paper at the top which details all of the contents, which we will unpack now!}

\emph{For today's session here are the materials we will use:}

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
\tightlist
\item
  Reward board with gold star stickers
\item
  2 pencils
\item
  A session booklet
\item
  Parent surveys booklet
\item
  Paper measuring tape
\item
  Hair sample kit
\item
  Saliva sample collection kit
\item
  Cardboard box with a bag and cotton balls inside
\end{enumerate}

It will also contain post-session materials. You will use these after today's session is complete:

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
\tightlist
\item
  Home session booklet
\item
  Bristol Stool Scale sheet
\item
  Stool sample collection kit
\item
  Cardboard box with bag and cotton balls inside
\item

\item
  Return mailer with FedEx slip attached on the top
\end{enumerate}

\emph{Please set aside the magic box for now but keep the materials near you as we may need to access materials from the magic box throughout today's session!}

\emph{What you can pull out now and use throughout the session is the Reward Board and Gold Star Stickers. Use this reward board to track all the steps you accomplish today! Each space is like each task for the session. Once you complete the task you can put a gold star on the space!}

\hypertarget{protocol---parent-child-observation}{%
\subsection{Protocol - Parent Child Observation}\label{protocol---parent-child-observation}}

The parent and child will be seated together in view on the Zoom camera. During that time they will be filmed while solving a conflict, and then again while discussing a pleasant event. The conflict event will always go first, followed by the pleasant event. We did this to ensure that the parents were not thinking of the negative interaction upon answering the questionnaires about their child, which they did immediately after the observation interaction.

Step 1:
The researcher will ask the parent to find the \href{https://ucla.app.box.com/file/630327764749}{Pleasant/Unpleasant Events Checklist} piece of paper from their session package.

\emph{Researcher: So the first thing we will have you pull out of the magic box is the paper packet titled ``Online Session Booklet.'' You can flip to the page that says ``Pleasant and Unpleasant Events Checklist.''}

Researcher will wait for the participant to find the Online Session Booklet and flip to the correct page.

\emph{Researcher: Next we are going to take some film of you while you discuss something that's hard and try to resolve it. On this piece of paper is a list of things that parents and children sometimes have disagreements about. We will give you a moment to read the list and think about some that you would like to discuss together. Then after about one minute, you will start discussing the things you have selected and try to resolve them. You do not need to tell us what you chose to discuss, and it does not matter if you chose something from this list, or decide to choose something else. I'll be there while you choose, but once we start recording I am going to step out out of the room to be away from the camera view and lower the volume on my computer so I won't be watching or listening during your conversation. I am not going to respond to you during this time. I will give you a total of five minutes once the recording begins. Take 1 minute now to choose.}

Step 2:
- Researcher set timer for 1 minute (mute self).
- Researcher will ensure Zoom security settings are set up for the video.
- Parent and child will be situated side-by-side in view on the Zoom camera.
- Researcher will rename the participant's name to the participant Secondary MBB ID number. \includegraphics{images/zoom_parent_child_interaction/1.png}

\emph{Ok, now it's time to get started. Remember, try to solve whatever problem or disagreement you talk about for the next five minutes. After, I will come back into the video call and give you further instructions. Do you have any questions?}

If no questions, proceed.

Step 3:
- Researcher will press record on the Zoom application. \includegraphics{images/zoom_parent_child_interaction/3.png} Wait to hear the audio Zoom confirmation \emph{``this meeting is now being recorded''} and view recording in progress at top left of screen to ensure recording is live. \includegraphics{images/zoom_parent_child_interaction/4.png}
- Researcher will ``hide self view'' \includegraphics{images/zoom_parent_child_interaction/2.png}
- Researcher will lower the volume on their computer (but do not mute computer volume entirely), and mute their audio on Zoom.
- Researcher will start timer for 5 minutes. At the end of 5 minutes, reenter camera view and turn up volume on researcher's computer.

\emph{Researcher: Thank you for taking the time to discuss something difficult. Next we are going to take some film of you talking about something nice. On your piece of paper is a list of fun things that parents and children sometimes do together. I will give you a moment to read the list and pick something that you would like to plan to do together. Then after about one minute, you will start discussing the things you have selected and try to plan them. You do not need to tell us what you chose to discuss, and it does not matter if you choose something from this list, or decide to choose something else. I'll be there while you choose, but once we start recording I am going to step out out of the room to be away from the camera view and lower the volume on my computer so I won't be watching or listening during your conversation. I am not going to respond to you during this time. I will give you a total of five minutes once the recording begins. Take 1 minute now to choose.}

Step 4:
- Researcher set timer for 1 minute (mute self).

\emph{Ok, now it's time to get started. Remember, try to plan whatever fun thing you talk about for the next five minutes. After, I will come back into the video call and give you further instructions. Do you have any questions?}

If no questions, proceed.

Step 5:
- Researcher will press record on the Zoom application. \includegraphics{images/zoom_parent_child_interaction/3.png} Wait to hear the audio Zoom confirmation \emph{``this meeting is now being recorded''} and view recording in progress at top left of screen to ensure recording is live. \includegraphics{images/zoom_parent_child_interaction/4.png}
- Researcher will ``hide self view'' \includegraphics{images/zoom_parent_child_interaction/2.png}
- Researcher will lower the volume on their computer (but do not mute computer volume entirely), and mute their audio on Zoom.
- Researcher will start timer for 5 minutes. At the end of 5 minutes, reenter camera view and turn up volume on researcher's computer.

Step 6:
Researcher reenters the room and back into camera view, turns up volume on the computer, and stops the recording on Zoom. \includegraphics{images/zoom_parent_child_interaction/5.png} You will view this notification in the upper right hand corner that states the recorded file will be converted to mp4 once the meeting ends. \includegraphics{images/zoom_parent_child_interaction/6.png} Move the child/adolescent and parent onto the next task in the session, as the video will not be saved until after the session is complete.

\textbf{Please visit "Post-Online Session Protocols to view instructions on how to save the video recording.}

\hypertarget{plan-b}{%
\subsubsection{Plan B}\label{plan-b}}

If Zoom recording is not possible, parents will be given same instructions - but told to record on their cell phone and upload to a secure private link.

Participants can access the link \href{https://ucla.app.box.com/f/3c52df2afb1a446ab363b793f8af22c1}{here}. Parents can access this link from their mobile phone or computer.

When they click on the link, they will see the screen below.

Parents can drag their video file directly from their phone/computer into the folder.

The video will appear to the researchers in our Box under BABLAB/Studies/Mind\_Brain\_Body/Data/Wave\_1\_online/Wave\_1\_online\_parent\_child\_interactions/Uploads

Videos can then be renamed and organized by the researcher.

\emph{Now we are done with the group activity. Next we will move on to some individual activities, where you the parent will complete some surveys while your child plays a computer game. The computer game is about your child's learning and memory so it is important they dont get help from you! We actually prefer you don't watch the screen so you dont know which pictures they see. If you recall the example from our powerpoint at the beginning of this session, this will be the time that your child will see some pictures on the screen}

\emph{So to get your child setup for the computer game, we will have you log go back to that ``LINKS EMAIL'' we sent right before the session to access a link to the activity. Once you find the email, please click on the link under ``Child Learning and Memory'' and let me know once you have done this.}
