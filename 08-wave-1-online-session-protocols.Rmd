## Online Session Protocols 

### Consent & Assent Online

Once the parent and child/teen have connected with the researcher via Zoom, the researcher may begin the consenting (parent) and assenting (child aged 7+ or teen) process.

Make some small talk - Ask the participant how they got here. If they have participated before in research. Thank them for joining you via video call and for giving up their weekend to help science.

Tell the parent and child that the first thing you are going to do is go over all of the things they will do today, and have them fill out the consent and assent forms online.

Speak to them and direct them through the whole process.

Things you will do during the online session:

- Sit with parent and talk about fun things and hard things (filming).
- Parent stays in room and answers more questions while child is working.
- Child will play a computer game (look at pictures). Some of the pictures will be a little bit scary, others sad, others boring.
- Parent will help child measure height, weight, and waist circumference.
- Child will answer some questionnaires with researcher
- Parent will help take two biological samples during the session:
  - Hair - stress hormones
  - Saliva - microbiome
- You will get $45 for the work you put in today

Things you will do at home (after the online session):

- Child Poop sample - microbiome
- Stool scale
- Memory game - to see what you remember from the session today
- When you complete the poop sample and the game at home, we will pay you another $20.

Things to know:

You are a volunteer, which means that you do not have to do anything, or say anything that makes you uncomfortable. We would like you to try everything you can, and to do your best, but if there are things you absolutely do not want to do, just tell us, that is o.k.

We keep your participation confidential - ID number.

We want you to come in again in the future, so we will ask for some information so we can contact you in the future.

Have the participant indicate consent/assent on REDCap consent form.

### Parent Child Observation Online

The parent and child will be seated together in view on the Zoom camera. During that time they will be filmed while planning a conflict event, and then again while discussing a pleasant event. The conflict event will always go first, followed by the pleasant event. We did this to ensure that the parents were not thinking of the negative interaction upon answering the questionnaires about their child, which they did immediately after the observation interaction.

Step 1: 
Researcher will ensure Zoom security settings are set up for the video.

- Parent and child will be situated side-by-side in view on the Zoom camera.
- Researcher will rename the participant's name to the participant Secondary MBB ID number. ![<!--- Zoom Parent Child Observation --->](images/zoom_parent_child_interaction/1.png)
- Researcher will "hide self view" ![<!--- Zoom Parent Child Observation --->](images/zoom_parent_child_interaction/2.png)

Step 2:
The researcher will ask the parent to find the [Pleasant/Unpleasant Events Checklist](https://ucla.app.box.com/file/630327764749) piece of paper from their session package.

*Researcher: Next we are going to take some film of you while you discuss a source of conflict (or something you disagree on) and try to resolve it. On this piece of paper is a list of things that parents and children sometimes have disagreements about. Please take a moment to read the list and think about some that you would like to discuss together. In about one minute, please start discussing the things you have selected from the list and try to resolve the areas of conflict you have chosen from the list. You do not need to tell us what you chose to discuss, and it does not matter if you chose something from the list, or decide to choose something else not included on the list. I am going to step out out of the room and away from the camera view, and silence my computer so I do not have a "virtual presence" during your conversation. I will give you five minutes to discuss the event, then I will come back into the video call and give you further instructions.*

Step 3: 
Researcher press record on the Zoom application.![<!--- Zoom Parent Child Observation --->](images/zoom_parent_child_interaction/3.png) Wait to hear the audio Zoom confirmation *"this meeting is now being recorded"* and view recording in progress at top left of screen to ensure recording is live. ![<!--- Zoom Parent Child Observation --->](images/zoom_parent_child_interaction/4.png) Researcher turn down the volume on the computer and leave the room. Start timer for 6 minutes. At the end of 6 minutes, reenter camera view and turn up volume on researcher's computer.

*Researcher: Thank you for taking the time to discuss the source of conflict and try to resolve it. Next we are going to take some film of you while you discuss a pleasant event you could do together. On your piece of paper is a list of events that parents and children sometimes find pleasant to do together. Please take a moment to read the list of events and think about what you would like to plan to do together. You do not need to tell us what you chose to discuss, and it does not matter if you chose something from the list, or decide to choose something else not included on the list. I am going to step out out of the room and away from the camera view once again, and silence my computer so I do not have a "virtual presence" during your conversation. I will give you five minutes to discuss the event, then I will come back into the video call and give you further instructions.*

Step 4:
Researcher keeps the recording going on Zoom and turns down the volume on the computer before leaving the room.

Step 5:
Researcher reenter the room and back into camera view, turn up volume on the computer, and stops the recording on Zoom. ![<!--- Zoom Parent Child Observation --->](images/zoom_parent_child_interaction/5.png) You will view this notification in the upper right hand corner that states the recorded file will be converted to mp4 once the meeting ends. ![<!--- Zoom Parent Child Observation --->](images/zoom_parent_child_interaction/6.png) Move the child/adolescent and parent onto the next task in the session, as the video will not be saved until after the session is complete.

**POST SESSION**

Step 6:
When the session is complete, click the bottom right hand button to end the meeting. ![<!--- Zoom Parent Child Observation --->](images/zoom_parent_child_interaction/7.png) You will immediately see this window pop up to indicate the recording is being converted and saving to your computer. ![<!--- Zoom Parent Child Observation --->](images/zoom_parent_child_interaction/8.png)
Step 7:
When the video conversion is complete, the video files will be saved in a folder titled "Zoom" on your computer, wherever your current automatic working directory is saved. ![<!--- Zoom Parent Child Observation --->](images/zoom_parent_child_interaction/9.png)
Step 8:
There will be three files in the folder- find the mp4 file and click open to ensure you have captured and converted the file successfully. ![<!--- Zoom Parent Child Observation --->](images/zoom_parent_child_interaction/10.png) Rename the file to the participant's secondary ID number, and upload to Box. ![<!--- Zoom Parent Child Observation --->](images/zoom_parent_child_interaction/11.png)
