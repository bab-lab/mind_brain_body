# SONA Collection 

Additional data collection of the 2 part Halloween task (for immediate and delayed testing of the memory task) will be taken with participants aged 18+. We project collecting from 250 participants (due to potential attrition of the 2 part task) and will compensate participants with school credit on the SONA system.
