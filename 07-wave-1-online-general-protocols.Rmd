#### Scheduling

2. Check-in with the Lab Manager to see what the designated "package mailing day" of the week is.
Participants must be scheduled 2 weeks or more in advance from the "package mailing day", to ensure appropriate time for the package to be received by the participant.
3. Create event on google calendar for 2 hours. Notify the participant that sessions may not last the full indicated time, however, we like to designate additional time just in case.
4. As soon as the participant has been scheduled, create/add to a google calendar event for the designated "package mailing day" of the week the participant ID (MBB number).
5. This will notify the Lab Manager to create a package for this participant with session and post-session materials when they go into the lab for "package mailing day."
