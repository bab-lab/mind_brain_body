### Protocol - Halloween Test Delay 

  

[Once Zoom is Connected] 

  

*Hello! Welcome back to Session 2!* [Ask how they are doing, and if they were able to do the Stool Sample collection. Answer any questions they have about their Home Session tasks (Stool sample, BSS sheet, Contact list, ASA)] 

  

*So today we are just going to do one quick task, collect the blood sample ( if stool sample is done), walk you through how to close up package and send it back to us, and then answer any questions you might have.* 

  

*OK! It is time to go back to our learning and memory section.* 

  

[Give child instructions on Halloween Test] [Researcher to open up the [halloween_part_3](https://ucla.app.box.com/file/737558206552)] 

  

*Ok [Child's name]- now we want to see how much of your trick-or-treating adventure you remember. You will see an instructions page like this first!* 

  

*You will first be shown food or a toy and will be asked if you saw that food or toy when you went trick-or-treating. This is where your memory kicks in!* 

  

*Here are some examples of what you might see.* 

  

*The next set of questions show the scenes that you visited and asks what food was found there and where it was located on the screen.* 

  

*Here are examples of what this looks like!* 

  

*We also want you to remember that this is not a test! Just try your best!* 

  

*When you finish, all you have to do is let me know!* 

  

[Researcher to stop sharing screen.] 

  

*So to get you setup for the computer game, we will send you a link through the Zoom chat now. Let me know once the link has loaded.* 

 

[Wait for child to log back on] 

  

If necessary - the link can be found [here](https://research.sc/participant/login/20451/publicid). 

  

[Confirm that they are on the correct page]  

  

[Once confirmed, say] *Ok! Now you can get started!* 

 

[Once finished with game] 

*[Child's name] great job! Now that we are done with the computer game.* 

 

### Protocol – Home Session Check In 

 

*I wanted to check in if you were able to do the poop sample, fill out the BSS and finish the parent_proxy and parent_self surveys?* 

 

If yes: *“ Great, thank you for completing all of that before our session today!* 

Proceed to doing blood sample.  

 

If no: * “ When do you think you will be able to finish? We will need to schedule a short 5 minute Zoom call within the next week so we can collect the blood sample. The sooner we are able to do that the better.* Schedule the third session within the next week at a time that works for you and the parent so blood sample can be collected. Emphasize that poop sample needs to collected before that session.

*Now we will be doing the blood sample. The kit comes with detailed instructions you can reference but I will also be going over with you right now. *

Peel paper tab behind the red button. Keep sample pod pointing down. 

Stick device to shoulder. Do not remove once it’s on. 

Press button quickly and firmly until it can’t go any farther. Wait two seconds then let go.  

Start a 5 minute timer. Keep arm at your side and watch dots fill. You won’t see blood right away.

-If the package is ready to be sent back we will do the blood sample *now* and it needs to be sent out today / tomorrow at the latest 

-it is important that the blood sample be sent back the day it is collected or day after so emphasize that it is important that the whole package get sent back asap after blood sample collection.

- Reference the Package Checklist which has a checklist for every item they need to send back to the lab 

- Everything goes into the mailer with the FedEx sheet on top 

- Double check that stool and saliva sample are correctly packed (tube in biohazard bag with absorbent, inside rigid white box) 

- Double check that blood sample is correctly packed ( in biohazard bag with absorbent, inside rigid white box) 

- Drop off at any FedEx location or post box 

  

### Protocol - Payment 

  

- Explain that once the return mailer has been received to the lab after the second session, we will send payment through the mail  

- Explain that they should expect an email from us when we send the package, and if they haven't heard from us one week after we have sent the package, call to check-in about the payment 

-Ask what prize they want. We will share screen and share the prize presentation. Whatever they choose researcher will make a note on checklist and lab manager will reference that when sending payment package. As prizes get claimed those choices will get crossed out.
