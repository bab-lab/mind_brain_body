## Protocols - Pre-Session 1 

### Protocol - Recruitment Online

#### Adding participants to Participant Database
* For when there is a new email interest form 
1. Verify that potential participant is actually a new participant 
    - In other words check Participant Database to check that they didn’t previously participate / fill out interest form before 
2. Add the info provided on interest submission ( name, age, email, phone number) 
3. For column labeled “Added”: 
    - Yes if you’ve added them to REDCap
    - No if they haven’t been added
    - Recommended that you add to REDCap immediately and reach out to them
4. Add participant to REDCap ( see below for full instructions) 
5. Move interest form email from inbox to “Added” tab of MBB 
    - “Move to” button is at top next to labels button, make sure you move not just put “Added” label 

#### Pre-Screening

 1. Check if participant is in Participant Database
     - If not, add them to the Participant Database ( see section above)
 3. Check if participant is in ID Drive
    - If yes, check if they have a Screener ID
    - If not, assign them a Screener ID once contact has been established based on the next available Screener ID # in REDCap and proceed with screening
    - If yes, proceed with screening under existing Screener ID in REDCap
    - Check participant tally before making call to see if they would be scheduled or waitlisted ( if we reached 15 participants for that age group) if eligible for study 

#### Screening

1. To screen a new participant click “Add / Edit Records”

9. Once done, select “Complete” and “Save & Exit Form”
    - The screen can be entered multiple times - for instance if there are multiple phone calls or contacts
    - It is important to keep a record of all instances of contact

![<!--- recap_screening --->](images/redcap_screening/6.png)
11. Select the appropriate option
     - Contact - Participant needs to be re-contacted (add Recruitment Database & ID Drive). Participants who are still too young to participate, or are unavailable at the moment should stay on this list but be set for a future recontact time/date. 
     - Ineligible - Participant not eligible for study
     - To Enroll - Participant to enroll (need to create subject ID, enter subject info, schedule participant, add to Participant Database, add to ID Drive)
     - Enrolled - Participant has been enrolled (all above have been completed)
     - To Remove - Participant wants to be removed
     - Out of Town- Participant lives outside of LA, and will not be returning after the pandemic. This is our "waitlist" of those we will contact if really necessary
12. Be sure to update the screen status after each contact
    - Update the recontact date on wave status 
        - One week from today (date you contacted them)
        - For individuals that have been unresponsive for long time ( 6+ months) two weeks is recontact date
     - After 3 contacts (with no response) - review (time of day, contact method, etc.)
13. If enrolled, proceed to pre-session checklist in the participant log
    - Highly recommended to do all post-enrollment tasks by following the “Pre-Session Checklist” on MBB participant log


#### Scheduling

1. Open BabLab google calendar and note availability for designated data collection research team.
2. Check-in with the Lab Manager to see what the designated "package mailing day" of the week is.
Participants must be scheduled 2 weeks or more in advance from the "package mailing day", to ensure appropriate time for the package to be received by the participant.
3. Create event on google calendar for 2 hours. Notify the participant that sessions may not last the full indicated time, however, we like to designate additional time just in case.
4. As soon as the participant has been scheduled, create/add to a google calendar event for the designated "package mailing day" of the week the participant ID (MBB number).
5. This will notify the Lab Manager to create a package for this participant with session and post-session materials when they go into the lab for "package mailing day."


#### Other Screening Information

<h4>Accessing Lists</h4>

To find out where participants are in the recruitment process, there are several lists. 
![<!--- recap_screening --->](images/redcap_screening/7.png)
1. Click on “Record Status Dashboard”
![<!--- recap_screening --->](images/redcap_screening/8.png)
2. Participants who have been enrolled will be listed in the Enrollment - Wave 1 list
3. Participants in the process of recruitment will be listed in one of the 4 Recruitment lists
    - *These lists are populated based on the individuals “Screen Status” so be sure to update after each contact!

<h4>List Types</h4>

- Contact - List of individuals who need to be contacted or re-contacted (also includes waitlist)
- Ineligible - Participants are ineligible but interested
- To Enroll - Participants who have been screened and are eligible to enroll
- To Remove - Participants who were not interested in being contacted for this or future research
- Out of Town- Participants who do not live in LA and will not be returning after the pandemic. This is a waitlist of individuals who we may contact if (1) we are behind on recruitment for Wave 1 and will need to just schedule people who we know cannot come back for future waves so we make sure we get data or (2) we have to stay in the pandemic and future waves will be remote.

### Protocol - Session Preparation 

#### Package creation

- There will be a designated "package mailing day" one day a week in which the Lab Manager will go into the lab to prepare necessary materials and send out packages from scheduled participants in the last week, on the same package mailing day.
