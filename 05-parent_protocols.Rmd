### Using the iPad for KSADS Summary Checklist

- Before the start of every session, be sure to duplicate and rename all the KSADS documents in Acrobat (25 documents per participant) and rename them (MBBXXX_KSADS_suppX_XXX). 
   - *Note 1:* This may take a while, especially if there are more than one participant, so be sure to do it ahead of time.
   - *Note 2:* With multiple participants in one session, keep them all on the same iPad as the same iPad will be used to administer all KSADS.

- Follow instructions below on how to duplicate and rename the documents:
   - Turn on iPad and go to the “Acrobat” app.
   - Your screen should look like this. If it does not, tap on “Files” at the bottom, and ensure that the Locations is set to “On This iPad”.

   - Do the same for all 25 documents (Duplicate, Rename).
