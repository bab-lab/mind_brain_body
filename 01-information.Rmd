#### Coding the Observation

- After the observation are collected, videos will be coded by two observers blind to the caregiving group of the child (adversity or comparison). 

- Our original plan was to follow the LIFE coding system developed by Hops:
   - Hops H, Davis B, Longoria N. Methodological issues in direct observation – Illustrations with the Living in Familial Environments (LIFE) coding system. Journal of Clinical Child Psychology. 1995;24:193–203. [Google Scholar](https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1207/s15374424jccp2402_7?journalCode=hcap19)

- However, this system is prohibitively expensive and very training intensive. Instead we decided to go with either of the following two coding schedules: 
   - 1. Family Interaction Macrocoding Schedule (FIMS) Holmbeck, Zebracki, Johnson, Belvedere, & Hommeyer, 2007.
   - 2. CIB Training with Ruth Feldman.
   
- We ultimately decided to go with FIMS for several reasons: 
    - Expense - Sarah Whittle paid approximately $ 1000USD for a 10 hour skype training session with one of Holmbeck’s team), whereas CIB training is /$2500 and also involves flights and accommodation at Yale. 
    - Validation in age range - I like CIB for younger children, but FIMS was designed for older children and adolescents, and Sarah Whittle has validated it in a community sample of 8 year olds and their mothers. 
    - FIMS is a less intensive coding schedule, producing global codes, rather than micro coded (i.e., minute to minute) scales - which makes more intuitive sense in the age range for MBB. 
    - FIMS has a peer version that we might brach out to in the future (but likely not needing further training): https://psycnet.apa.org/record/2014-24011-001
    - Sarah Whittle’s group looked at the component structure for the FIMS and found components that seemed close to what they were finding with the Hops LIFE system - namely: negative maternal affect during pleasant event, negative maternal during conflict discussion, and pleasant maternal affect across both tasks (warmth). The negative maternal during pleasant event was the most predictive of child behavior problems. Overall, the correlations they report in their paper are all very sensical and convinced me that we should use the FIMS. https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/full/10.1177/1073191118796557

### Interview

-----------------

### Physiology

#### Memory Intrusion/Movie Watching

- Physiology Marks:
   - We have inserted start and stop times for the physiology for the movie component of the task, which will be used for one of the analyses. We have also inserted physiology marks for the start and stop times for each of the word lists, and finally for the recall phases. Note: be careful using physiology during the recall phase, as the participant is talking during that phase.
