## W1-O Protocols - Final

### W1-O Protocol - Storing Saliva Sample 

- Screw lids on very tight (to prevent evaporation)
- Log the location (grid) on the sample storage log

-----------------

### W1-O Protocol - Storing Hair Sample 

- Store the sample in a dry area at room temperature

-----------------

### W1-O Protocol - Storing Stool Sample

#### Sample Quality 

- Put on gloves.
- Open the mailer to ensure that it contains both the stool sample (in biohazard bag) and the Bristol Stool Scale.
- Check for quality of the stool sample by shaking it up and down vigorously (keep the sample in the biohazard bag), then check for its consistency and color - It should be a dark-brown liquid.
- If stool sample does not meet requirement (e.g. sample is in solid form or amount collected is too little), contact the family to see if they would be willing to send another sample with compensation. 
- Contact family if the Bristol Stool Scale is missing in the mailer. 

#### Sample Transfer

- Wear appropriate PPE:
    - Gloves
    - Lab coat
    - Safety glasses
    - Surgical Mask
    - Closed-toe shoes
    - Long pants
    - Hair tied back
    

- Prepare your station and ensure that you have the following:
    - Drape
    - 2.0mL cryogenic vials 
    - Stool samples in biohazard bag 
    - Test tube racks
    - Transport box with divider
    - Sharpie for labeling


**Steps:**

- Lay a new drape on the work station and keep all equipments and sample on the drape throughout the transfer process.
- With the stool sample collection vial still in the biohazard bag, shake it up and down vigorously.
- Take the stool sample out of the bag and put it on the test tube rack.
- Untwist two 2.0mL vials and place them on the test tube rack. 
- Untwist the stool sample collection vial, and carefully pour the sample into the first 2.0mL vial. (It’s okay if the ball does or does not get transferred)
- Stop pouring when solution reached the 1.8mL line to prevent overflow, and pour the remaining sample (if any) in a second 2.0mL vial. 
- Cap the 2.0mL vials tightly to prevent spills. 
- Label the 2.0mL vials with a sharpie, ensure it has the participant ID and Wave and vial number.
- Place the labeled 2.0mL vials in the transport box with divider.
- Close the now-empty stool sample collection vial, put it back in the biohazard bag, and dispose it in the biohazard waste bin. 
- Clean up work station, dispose the drape, and wipe down the table top with disinfectant wipe.
- Remove PPE and wash hands with soap and water thoroughly.
- Bring the transport box to C454 where the -80˚C freezer is located (key in BABLab Lock Box).
- Place the 2.0mL vials in their designated space in the freezer box (in accordance to the Sample Storage Log Diagram). 
- Log the sample in the [Sample Storage Log](https://app.box.com/file/630322897864).

### W1-O Protocol - Data Entry Check Board Audits 

RA’s will be conducting Data Entry Checks to ensure that all data collected from MBB participants is accurately entered in REDcap. To audit the data entry checks, read over all notes in the Data Entry CHECK tab in the MBB_participant_log to identify errors that need to be fixed (ie. data entered incorrectly, discrepancy between paper copy and REDcap form).

1.	Open the MBB_participant_log and go to the Data Entry CHECK tab for whichever wave you are checking.

    **GREEN** items are attributed to completed/accurate sections, OR if an RA had found a discrepancy between the REDcap and paper copy and was able to fix it themselves.

    **YELLOW** items are attributed to incomplete sections where:
      - participant did not complete (paper is blank)
      - participant was not given this survey (not given on paper)

      These items were most likely not completed by the participant, so there will be no data to verify.

    **RED** items are attributed to sections where:
      - data is missing on REDCap from paper copy, but no place to put it on REDCap
      - data is added on REDCap but not on paper copy
      - data entry is missing but illegible
      - any other less common discrepancies that need to be double checked
      
      **These items have been flagged by an RA and require auditing.**

2. Open REDcap and go to corresponding MBB participant that requires auditing.
    - For any flagged items, read notes on Participant Log and the participant’s REDCap to get an idea of the issue.  If necessary, locate the participant’s paper copy in their “Data” folder to verify the discrepancy. (Can be found in BABLAB > Studies >  Mind_Brain_Body > Data > (wave) > Wave_online_data)

**IF** the issue is fixable, edit the item on REDcap to match the paper copy, and note the item as Complete on the MBB_participant_log.

**IF** there is a discrepancy between the paper copy and REDcap, check an updated version of the paper copy to verify whether this discrepancy has been fixed since the participant completed the study. The paper copies can be found at BABLAB > Studies > Mind_Brain_Body > Documents > Questionnaires > Wave_X (specific to which wave you are checking)
  - If the paper copy has not been updated, make a note and report to lab manager.
  - Either way, ask lab manager whether we need to contact participant to retrieve the missing data. 

**IF** the issue is not fixable – write detailed notes of where the discrepancy needs to be fixed, and report it to the Lab Manager. Lab Manager should assess the amount of items missing, the importance of the items to the scale and to the overall study, and the process in which audits have been conducted to see if it would be convenient to re-request such information. After assessing such details, the Lab Manager should decide how to proceed with the issue on a base-by-base situation. 

**IF** there is an instance where the paper copy is illegible, or multiple options have been selected, verify with Lab Manager on how it should be entered onto REDcap. Lab Manager should refer to the above details to assess what the importance of the item is. Lab Manager should then decide whether or not to recontact the participant for explanations on illegible handwriting.


**Examples:** 

**Participant:** MBB033

**Item:** Covid_Objective_Parentproxy

**Issue:** “Did your child’s school close due to outbreak” answer not inputted into Redcap, which didn’t activate the rest of questions to be entered. Participant answered “Yes” and “homeschooled” and answered rest of questions, however the follow-up questions were not inputted into redcap, because only one option can be selected for “Did your child’s school close due to outbreak”

**Resolve:** In this situation, we may assume that the participant should have circled “yes” in order to activate the branch logic-ed items on REDCap that they did fill out on paper, which must have applied to them. 


**Participant:** MBB033

**Item:** Demographics_parentproxy

**Issue:** Participant selected “bachelors degree” AND “other” and wrote Theatre degree

**Resolve:** Because we are looking how many years they studied (professional; bachelors, etc.) it doesn’t matter which type of degree they specify if so.


**Participant:** MBB035

**Item:** Cbcl_parentproxy

**Issue:** Participant selected “not true” AND “sometimes true” however, it looks like a mistake because they often erased and changed their answers and may have forgotten to erase one of the checkmarks.

**Resolve:** For not true and sometimes true, probably would make it sometimes true (not zero)
For sometimes true and true, choose the middle - So select sometimes true in this case. The one that would impact composite the least.

### W1-O Protocol - Report Card

Scored Cbcl data for the report cards can be found in BABLAB/Studies/Mind_Brain_Body/Scripts/Wave_1/Data_scoring/Cbcl/cbcl_scored

**Running script to get cbcl data ready**

1. Ask lab manager to update REDCap raw data file.

2. Open the R script for scoring cbcl using RStudio. **Make sure you open with desktop Box** BABLAB/Studies/Mind_Brain_Body/Scripts/Wave_1/Data_scoring/Cbcl/cbcl_scoring.Rmd

![<!--- Report card Online --->](images/report_card_online/7.png)

3. Change the line with file name so it has the most updated file. 
![<!--- Report card Online --->](images/report_card_online/8.png)

3.1 To access the raw data file name go to BABLAB/Studies/Mind_Brain_Body/Scripts/Data and look for most recent date. 
![<!--- Report card Online --->](images/report_card_online/9.png)

4. Run the script by clicking run all. 
   -  *if there is an error saying data file couldn't be found make sure the file name is correct*
   - *Make sure you have all the "packages" needed for the script downloaded in your RStudio*
![<!--- Report card Online --->](images/report_card_online/8.png)


**Making report card**

1. Open a participant data folder - BABLAB/Studies/Mind_Brain_Body/Data/Wave_1_online/Wave_1_online_data/

![<!--- Report card Online --->](images/report_card_online/1.png)

2. Navigate to the report card folder and rename the template file - MBB999 to the relevant participant - and open the file

![<!--- Report card Online --->](images/report_card_online/2.png)


3. Navigate to the last page of the pdf and fill in the scores for this participant. You can type directly on the page- it is a fillable form.

![<!--- Report card Online --->](images/report_card_online/3.png)

4. The data you are inputting into the report card comes from the file titled "Cbcl_scored.csv" which can be found in BABLAB/Studies/Mind_Brain_Body/Scripts/Wave_1/Data_scoring/Cbcl
![<!--- Report card Online --->](images/report_card_online/10.png)

4.1 Some info about the scored cbcl data file

  - *Make sure you do not save any changes you make to the cbcl file. Open the file on Desktop Box*
  
  - You can freeze the first row of the data by going to Layout tab and then the Window section. Click on freeze first row
![<!--- Report card Online --->](images/report_card_online/11.png)


  - Make the names of the columns fully visible by clicking on the 1 to highlight row 1 then clicking Wrap text.
  
![<!--- Report card Online --->](images/report_card_online/12.png)


5. After you have entered the data, it should look like this:
![<!--- Report card Online --->](images/report_card_online/4.png)


6. If there are any comments, enter them on the comments page.
  - For example, if any NA’s are present due to less than 70% of data for that subset being available to calculate a score - note that here.
  - If there are no comments, delete this page.
![<!--- Report card Online --->](images/report_card_online/5.png)

7. **Important**- Once you have completed the edits to the pdf, you must follow these steps to “lock” the data so that it is no longer editable before sending to the participant. To do so, click file/print/PDF/Save as PDF. Save the PDF to your desktop, then replace the original PDF with the desktop version.

![<!--- Report card Online --->](images/report_card_online/6.png)

8. The report card is now ready to be sent to the participant.

Notes: 

  - If the scores for a particular participant seem off check in with the lab manager so they can verify there isn't something wrong with the cbcl script

  - The fill in spots for the aggressive behavior row don't match the rest of the document so there are two small text boxes where you can put in the values

**Sending report card email**

1. Make a copy of certificate template on your desktop, type in participant name, and save as a pdf
    - certificate is in BABLAB/Studies/Mind_Brain_Body/Payment/Wave_1/Wave_1_print
    - when you save it as a pdf open it then rotate it so the pdf is oriented correctly

2. Open participant's report card pdf and save a copy to your desktop *without the participant ID* which will be attached to email

3. Open up report card email template & fill in highlighted parts

4. Attach thank you letter, cerificate, and report card to email
